    "copyright": "",
    "licenseFile": "node_modules/@vue/component-compiler-utils/README.md",
    "licenseText": "# @vue/component-compiler-utils [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/vuejs/component-compiler-utils/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/vuejs/component-compiler-utils/)\n\n> Lower level utilities for compiling Vue single file components\n\nThis package contains lower level utilities that you can use if you are writing a plugin / transform for a bundler or module system that compiles Vue single file components into JavaScript. It is used in [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) version 15 and above.\n\nThe API surface is intentionally minimal - the goal is to reuse as much as possible while being as flexible as possible.\n\n## Why isn't `vue-template-compiler` a peerDependency?\n\nSince this package is more often used as a low-level utility, it is usually a transitive dependency in an actual Vue project. It is therefore the responsibility of the higher-level package (e.g. `vue-loader`) to inject `vue-template-compiler` via options when calling the `parse` and `compileTemplate` methods.\n\nNot listing it as a peer depedency also allows tooling authors to use a non-default template compiler instead of `vue-template-compiler` without having to include it just to fullfil the peer dep requirement.\n\n## API\n\n### parse(ParseOptions): SFCDescriptor\n\nParse raw single file component source into a descriptor with source maps. The actual compiler (`vue-template-compiler`) must be passed in via the `compiler` option so that the specific version used can be determined by the end user.\n\n``` ts\ninterface ParseOptions {\n  source: string\n  filename?: string\n  compiler: VueTemplateCompiler\n  // https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler#compilerparsecomponentfile-options\n  // default: { pad: 'line' }\n  compilerParseOptions?: VueTemplateCompilerParseOptions\n  sourceRoot?: string\n  needMap?: boolean\n}\n\ninterface SFCDescriptor {\n  template: SFCBlock | null\n  script: SFCBlock | null\n  styles: SFCBlock[]\n  customBlocks: SFCCustomBlock[]\n}\n\ninterface SFCCustomBlock {\n  type: string\n  content: string\n  attrs: { [key: string]: string | true }\n  start: number\n  end: number\n  map?: RawSourceMap\n}\n\ninterface SFCBlock extends SFCCustomBlock {\n  lang?: string\n  src?: string\n  scoped?: boolean\n  module?: string | boolean\n}\n```\n\n### compileTemplate(TemplateCompileOptions): TemplateCompileResults\n\nTakes raw template source and compile it into JavaScript code. The actual compiler (`vue-template-compiler`) must be passed in via the `compiler` option so that the specific version used can be determined by the end user.\n\nIt can also optionally perform pre-processing for any templating engine supported by [consolidate](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js/).\n\n``` ts\ninterface TemplateCompileOptions {\n  source: string\n  filename: string\n\n  compiler: VueTemplateCompiler\n  // https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler#compilercompiletemplate-options\n  // default: {}\n  compilerOptions?: VueTemplateCompilerOptions\n\n  // Template preprocessor\n  preprocessLang?: string\n  preprocessOptions?: any\n\n  // Transform asset urls found in the template into `require()` calls\n  // This is off by default. If set to true, the default value is\n  // {\n  //   audio: 'src',\n  //   video: ['src', 'poster'],\n  //   source: 'src',\n  //   img: 'src',\n  //   image: ['xlink:href', 'href'],\n  //   use: ['xlink:href', 'href']\n  // }\n  transformAssetUrls?: AssetURLOptions | boolean\n\n  // For vue-template-es2015-compiler, which is a fork of Buble\n  transpileOptions?: any\n\n  isProduction?: boolean  // default: false\n  isFunctional?: boolean  // default: false\n  optimizeSSR?: boolean   // default: false\n\n  // Whether prettify compiled render function or not (development only)\n  // default: true\n  prettify?: boolean\n}\n\ninterface TemplateCompileResult {\n  ast: Object | undefined\n  code: string\n  source: string\n  tips: string[]\n  errors: string[]\n}\n\ninterface AssetURLOptions {\n  [name: string]: string | string[]\n}\n```\n\n#### Handling the Output\n\nThe resulting JavaScript code will look like this:\n\n``` js\nvar render = function (h) { /* ... */}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function (h) { /* ... */}, function (h) { /* ... */}]\n```\n\nIt **does NOT** assume any module system. It is your responsibility to handle the exports, if needed.\n\n### compileStyle(StyleCompileOptions)\n\nTake input raw CSS and applies scoped CSS transform. It does NOT handle pre-processors. If the component doesn't use scoped CSS then this step can be skipped.\n\n``` ts\ninterface StyleCompileOptions {\n  source: string\n  filename: string\n  id: string\n  map?: any\n  scoped?: boolean\n  trim?: boolean\n  preprocessLang?: string\n  preprocessOptions?: any\n  postcssOptions?: any\n  postcssPlugins?: any[]\n}\n\ninterface StyleCompileResults {\n  code: string\n  map: any | void\n  rawResult: LazyResult | void // raw lazy result from PostCSS\n  errors: string[]\n}\n```\n\n### compileStyleAsync(StyleCompileOptions)\n\nSame as `compileStyle(StyleCompileOptions)` but it returns a Promise resolving to `StyleCompileResults`. It can be used with async postcss plugins.",

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseFile": "node_modules/assert-plus/README.md",
    "licenseText": "# assert-plus\n\nThis library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two\nthings: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable\nNODE\\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like\n`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n```javascript\n    var assert = require('assert-plus');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n        assert.object(options, 'options');\n        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');\n        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');\n        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');\n        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');\n        assert.func(callback, 'callback');\n\n        // Do stuff\n        callback(null, {});\n    }\n```\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.string(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n```javascript\n    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');\n```\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are\nalso disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from\nthe `assert` module avoids this behavior.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.array\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.finite\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.stream\n* assert.date\n* assert.regexp\n* assert.uuid\n* assert.arrayOfArray\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfBuffer\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfFinite\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.arrayOfStream\n* assert.arrayOfDate\n* assert.arrayOfRegexp\n* assert.arrayOfUuid\n* assert.optionalArray\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalFinite\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalStream\n* assert.optionalDate\n* assert.optionalRegexp\n* assert.optionalUuid\n* assert.optionalArrayOfArray\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFinite\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfStream\n* assert.optionalArrayOfDate\n* assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp\n* assert.optionalArrayOfUuid\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Not available when using the CLI, [use `--no-babelrc` instead](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli#ignoring-babelrc). |\n| `code`                   | `true`               | Enable code generation |\n| `comments`               | `true`               | Output comments in generated output. |\n| `compact`                | `\"auto\"`             | Do not include superfluous whitespace characters and line terminators. When set to `\"auto\"` compact is set to `true` on input sizes of >500KB. |\n| `env`                    | `{}`                 | This is an object of keys that represent different environments. For example, you may have: `{ env: { production: { /* specific options */ } } }` which will use those options when the environment variable `BABEL_ENV` is set to `\"production\"`. If `BABEL_ENV` isn't set then `NODE_ENV` will be used, if it's not set then it defaults to `\"development\"` |\n| `extends`                | `null`               | A path to an `.babelrc` file to extend |\n| `filename`               | `\"unknown\"`          | Filename for use in errors etc. |\n| `filenameRelative`       | `(filename)`         | Filename relative to `sourceRoot`. |\n| `generatorOpts`          | `{}`                 | An object containing the options to be passed down to the babel code generator, babel-generator |\n| `getModuleId`            | `null`               | Specify a custom callback to generate a module id with.

By default, all modules are anonymous. (Not available for `common` modules) |\n| `moduleRoot`             | `(sourceRoot)`       | Optional prefix for the AMD module formatter that will be prepend to the filename on module definitions. |\n| `only`                   | `null`               | A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch), regex, or mixed array of both, matching paths to **only** compile. Can also be an array of arrays containing paths to explicitly match. When attempting to compile a non-matching file it's returned verbatim. |\n| `parserOpts`             | `{}`                 | An object containing the options to be passed down to the babel parser, babylon |\n| `plugins`                | `[]`                 | List of [plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins) to load and use. |\n| `presets`                | `[]`                 | List of [presets](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins#presets) (a set of plugins) to load and use. |\n| `retainLines`            | `false`              | Retain line numbers. This will lead to wacky code but is handy for scenarios where you can't use source maps. (**NOTE:** This will not retain the columns) |\n| `resolveModuleSource`    | `null`               | Resolve a module source ie. `import \"SOURCE\";` to a custom value. Called as `resolveModuleSource(source, filename)`. |\n| `shouldPrintComment`     | `null`               | An optional callback that controls whether a comment should be output or not. Called as `shouldPrintComment(commentContents)`. **NOTE:** This overrides the `comment` option when used. |\n| `sourceFileName`         | `(filenameRelative)` | Set `sources[0]` on returned source map. |\n| `sourceMaps`             | `false`              | If truthy, adds a `map` property to returned output. If set to `\"inline\"`, a comment with a sourceMappingURL directive is added to the bottom of the returned code. If set to `\"both\"` then a `map` property is returned as well as a source map comment appended. **This does not emit sourcemap files by itself!** To have sourcemaps emitted using the CLI, you must pass it the `--source-maps` option. |\n| `sourceMapTarget`        | `(filenameRelative)` | Set `file` on returned source map. |\n| `sourceRoot`             | `(moduleRoot)`       | The root from which all sources are relative. |\n| `sourceType`             | `\"module\"`           | Indicate the mode the code should be parsed in. Can be either \"script\" or \"module\". |\n| `wrapPluginVisitorMethod`| `null`               | An optional callback that can be used to wrap visitor methods. **NOTE:** This is useful for things like introspection, and not really needed for implementing anything. Called as `wrapPluginVisitorMethod(pluginAlias, visitorType, callback)`.",

This will only be used if `code` is a string.\n\n## AST from Multiple Sources\n\nIn most cases, Babel does a 1:1 transformation of input-file to output-file.  However,\nyou may be dealing with AST constructed from multiple sources - JS files, templates, etc.\nIf this is the case, and you want the sourcemaps to reflect the correct sources, you'll need\nto pass an object to `generate` as the `code` parameter.  Keys\nshould be the source filenames, and values should be the source content.\n\nHere's an example of what that might look like:\n\n```js\nimport {parse} from 'babylon';\nimport generate from 'babel-generator';\n\nconst a = 'var a = 1;';\nconst b = 'var b = 2;';\nconst astA = parse(a, { sourceFilename: 'a.js' });\nconst astB = parse(b, { sourceFilename: 'b.js' });\nconst ast = {\n  type: 'Program',\n  body: [].concat(astA.program.body, astB.program.body)\n};\n\nconst { code, map } = generate(ast, { sourceMaps: true }, {\n  'a.js': a,\n  'b.js': b\n});\n\n// Sourcemap will point to both a.js and b.js where appropriate.\n```",

When in loose mode these are allowed to be used anywhere.\n\nAnd by default, when using exports with babel a non-enumerable `__esModule` property\nis exported.\n\n```javascript\nvar foo = exports.foo = 5;\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n```\n\nIn environments that don't support this you can enable loose mode on `babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs`\nand instead of using `Object.defineProperty` an assignment will be used instead.\n\n```javascript\nvar foo = exports.foo = 5;\nexports.__esModule = true;\n```\n\n### `strict`\n\n`boolean`, defaults to `false`\n\nBy default, when using exports with babel a non-enumerable `__esModule` property\nis exported. In some cases this property is used to determine if the import _is_ the\ndefault export or if it _contains_ the default export.\n\n```javascript\nvar foo = exports.foo = 5;\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n```\n\nIn order to prevent the `__esModule` property from being exported, you can set\nthe `strict` option to `true`.\n\n### `noInterop`\n\n`boolean`, defaults to `false`\n\nBy default, when using exports with babel a non-enumerable `__esModule` property\nis exported. This property is then used to determine if the import _is_ the default\nexport or if it _contains_ the default export.\n\n```javascript\n\"use strict\";\n\nvar _foo = require(\"foo\");\n\nvar _foo2 = _interopRequireDefault(_foo);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) {\n  return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj };\n}\n```\n\nIn cases where the auto-unwrapping of `default` is not needed, you can set the\n`noInterop` option to `true` to avoid the usage of the `interopRequireDefault`\nhelper (shown in inline form above).",

For example the `es6-promise` library exposes itself\nas `global.Promise` rather than `global.es6Promise`. This can be accommodated by:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\"transform-es2015-modules-umd\", {\n      \"globals\": {\n        \"es6-promise\": \"Promise\"\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Default semantics\n\nThere are a few things to note about the default semantics.\n\n_First_, this transform uses the\n[basename](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basename) of each import to generate\nthe global names in the UMD output. This means that if you're importing\nmultiple modules with the same basename, like:\n\n```js\nimport fooBar1 from \"foo-bar\";\nimport fooBar2 from \"./mylib/foo-bar\";\n```\n\nit will transpile into two references to the same browser global:\n\n```js\nfactory(global.fooBar, global.fooBar);\n```\n\nIf you set the plugin options to:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"globals\": {\n    \"foo-bar\": \"fooBAR\",\n    \"./mylib/foo-bar\": \"mylib.fooBar\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nit will still transpile both to one browser global:\n\n```js\nfactory(global.fooBAR, global.fooBAR);\n```\n\nbecause again the transform is only using the basename of the import.\n\n_Second_, the specified override will still be passed to the `toIdentifier`\nfunction in [babel-types/src/converters](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-types/src/converters.js).\nThis means that if you specify an override as a member expression like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"globals\": {\n    \"fizzbuzz\": \"fizz.buzz\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nthis will _not_ transpile to `factory(global.fizz.buzz)`. Instead, it will\ntranspile to `factory(global.fizzBuzz)` based on the logic in `toIdentifier`.\n\n_Third_, you cannot override the exported global name.\n\n#### More flexible semantics with `exactGlobals: true`\n\nAll of these behaviors can limit the flexibility of the `globals` map. To\nremove these limitations, you can set the `exactGlobals` option to `true`.\nDoing this instructs the plugin to:\n\n1. always use the full import string instead of the basename when generating\nthe global names\n2. skip passing `globals` overrides to the `toIdentifier` function. Instead,\nthey are used exactly as written, so you will get errors if you do not use\nvalid identifiers or valid uncomputed (dot) member expressions.\n3. allow the exported global name to be overridden via the `globals` map. Any\noverride must again be a valid identifier or valid member expression.\n\nThus, if you set `exactGlobals` to `true` and do not pass any overrides, the\nfirst example of:\n\n```js\nimport fooBar1 from \"foo-bar\";\nimport fooBar2 from \"./mylib/foo-bar\";\n```\n\nwill transpile to:\n\n```js\nfactory(global.fooBar, global.mylibFooBar);\n```\n\nAnd if you set the plugin options to:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"globals\": {\n    \"foo-bar\": \"fooBAR\",\n    \"./mylib/foo-bar\": \"mylib.fooBar\"\n  },\n  \"exactGlobals\": true\n}\n```\n\nthen it'll transpile to:\n\n```js\nfactory(global.fooBAR, global.mylib.fooBar)\n```\n\nFinally, with the plugin options set to:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"external-helpers\",\n    [\"transform-es2015-modules-umd\", {\n      \"globals\": {\n        \"my/custom/module/name\": \"My.Custom.Module.Name\"\n      },\n      \"exactGlobals\": true\n    }]\n  ],\n  \"moduleId\": \"my/custom/module/name\"\n}\n```\n\nit will transpile to:\n\n```js\nfactory(mod.exports);\nglobal.My = global.My || {};\nglobal.My.Custom = global.My.Custom || {};\nglobal.My.Custom.Module = global.My.Custom.Module || {};\nglobal.My.Custom.Module.Name = mod.exports;\n```\n\n### Via CLI\n\n```sh\nbabel --plugins transform-es2015-modules-umd script.js\n```\n\n### Via Node API\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\"babel-core\").transform(\"code\", {\n  plugins: [\"transform-es2015-modules-umd\"]\n});\n```",

    "licenseText": "# babel-plugin-transform-runtime\n\n> Externalise references to helpers and builtins, automatically polyfilling your code without polluting globals. (This plugin is recommended in a library/tool)\n\nNOTE: Instance methods such as `\"foobar\".includes(\"foo\")` will not work since that would require modification of existing builtins (Use [`babel-polyfill`](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill) for that).\n\n## Why?\n\nBabel uses very small helpers for common functions such as `_extend`. By default this will be added to every file that requires it. This duplication is sometimes unnecessary, especially when your application is spread out over multiple files.\n\nThis is where the `transform-runtime` plugin comes in: all of the helpers will reference the module `babel-runtime` to avoid duplication across your compiled output. The runtime will be compiled into your build.\n\nAnother purpose of this transformer is to create a sandboxed environment for your code. If you use [babel-polyfill](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) and the built-ins it provides such as `Promise`, `Set` and `Map`, those will pollute the global scope. While this might be ok for an app or a command line tool, it becomes a problem if your code is a library which you intend to publish for others to use or if you can't exactly control the environment in which your code will run.\n\nThe transformer will alias these built-ins to `core-js` so you can use them seamlessly without having to require the polyfill.\n\nSee the [technical details](#technical-details) section for more information on how this works and the types of transformations that occur.\n\n## Installation\n\n**NOTE - Production vs. development dependencies**\n\nIn most cases, you should install `babel-plugin-transform-runtime` as a development dependency (with `--save-dev`).\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-runtime\n```\n\nand `babel-runtime` as a production dependency (with `--save`).\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save babel-runtime\n```\n\nThe transformation plugin is typically used only in development, but the runtime itself will be depended on by your deployed/published code. See the examples below for more details.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)\n\nAdd the following line to your `.babelrc` file:\n\n```js\n// without options\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"transform-runtime\"]\n}\n\n// with options\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\"transform-runtime\", {\n      \"helpers\": false, // defaults to true\n      \"polyfill\": false, // defaults to true\n      \"regenerator\": true, // defaults to true\n      \"moduleName\": \"babel-runtime\" // defaults to \"babel-runtime\"\n    }]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Via CLI\n\n```sh\nbabel --plugins transform-runtime script.js\n```\n\n### Via Node API\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\"babel-core\").transform(\"code\", {\n  plugins: [\"transform-runtime\"]\n});\n```\n\n## Technical details\n\nThe `runtime` transformer plugin does three things:\n\n* Automatically requires `babel-runtime/regenerator` when you use generators/async functions.\n* Automatically requires `babel-runtime/core-js` and maps ES6 static methods and built-ins.\n* Removes the inline babel helpers and uses the module `babel-runtime/helpers` instead.\n\nWhat does this actually mean though? Basically, you can use built-ins such as `Promise`, `Set`, `Symbol` etc as well use all the Babel features that require a polyfill seamlessly, without global pollution, making it extremely suitable for libraries.\n\nMake sure you include `babel-runtime` as a dependency.\n\n### Regenerator aliasing\n\nWhenever you use a generator function or async function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction* foo() {\n\n}\n```\n\nthe following is generated:\n\n```javascript\n\"use strict\";\n\nvar _marked = [foo].map(regeneratorRuntime.mark);\n\nfunction foo() {\n  return regeneratorRuntime.wrap(function foo$(_context) {\n    while (1) switch (_context.prev = _context.next) {\n      case 0:\n      case \"end\":\n        return _context.stop();\n    }\n  }, _marked[0], this);\n}\n```\n\nThis isn't ideal as then you have to include the regenerator runtime which\npollutes the global scope.\n\nInstead what the `runtime` transformer does it compile that to:\n\n```javascript\n\"use strict\";\n\nvar _regenerator = require(\"babel-runtime/regenerator\");\n\nvar _regenerator2 = _interopRequireDefault(_regenerator);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\nvar _marked = [foo].map(_regenerator2.default.mark);\n\nfunction foo() {\n  return regeneratorRuntime.wrap(function foo$(_context) {\n    while (1) switch (_context.prev = _context.next) {\n      case 0:\n      case \"end\":\n        return _context.stop();\n    }\n  }, _marked[0], this);\n}\n```\n\nThis means that you can use the regenerator runtime without polluting your current environment.\n\n### `core-js` aliasing\n\nSometimes you may want to use new built-ins such as `Map`, `Set`, `Promise` etc. Your only way\nto use these is usually to include a globally polluting polyfill.\n\nWhat the `runtime` transformer does is transform the following:\n\n```javascript\nvar sym = Symbol();\n\nvar promise = new Promise;\n\nconsole.log(arr[Symbol.iterator]());\n```\n\ninto the following:\n\n```javascript\n\"use strict\";\n\nvar _getIterator2 = require(\"babel-runtime/core-js/get-iterator\");\n\nvar _getIterator3 = _interopRequireDefault(_getIterator2);\n\nvar _promise = require(\"babel-runtime/core-js/promise\");\n\nvar _promise2 = _interopRequireDefault(_promise);\n\nvar _symbol = require(\"babel-runtime/core-js/symbol\");\n\nvar _symbol2 = _interopRequireDefault(_symbol);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\nvar sym = (0, _symbol2.default)();\n\nvar promise = new _promise2.default();\n\nconsole.log((0, _getIterator3.default)(arr));\n```\n\nThis means is that you can seamlessly use these native built-ins and static methods\nwithout worrying about where they come from.\n\n**NOTE:** Instance methods such as `\"foobar\".includes(\"foo\")` will **not** work.\n\n### Helper aliasing\n\nUsually babel will place helpers at the top of your file to do common tasks to avoid\nduplicating the code around in the current file. Sometimes these helpers can get a\nlittle bulky and add unnecessary duplication across files. The `runtime`\ntransformer replaces all the helper calls to a module.\n\nThat means that the following code:\n\n```javascript\nclass Person {\n}\n```\n\nusually turns into:\n\n```javascript\n\"use strict\";\n\nfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\nvar Person = function Person() {\n  _classCallCheck(this, Person);\n};\n```\n\nthe `runtime` transformer however turns this into:\n\n```javascript\n\"use strict\";\n\nvar _classCallCheck2 = require(\"babel-runtime/helpers/classCallCheck\");\n\nvar _classCallCheck3 = _interopRequireDefault(_classCallCheck2);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\nvar Person = function Person() {\n  (0, _classCallCheck3.default)(this, Person);\n};\n```",

You can\noverride this by passing an ignore regex via:\n\n```js\nrequire(\"babel-register\")({\n  // This will override `node_modules` ignoring - you can alternatively pass\n  // an array of strings to be explicitly matched or a regex / glob\n  ignore: false\n});\n```\n\n## Specifying options\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\"babel-register\")({\n  // Optional ignore regex - if any filenames **do** match this regex then they\n  // aren't compiled.\n  ignore: /regex/,\n\n  // Ignore can also be specified as a function.\n  ignore: function(filename) {\n    if (filename === \"/path/to/es6-file.js\") {\n      return false;\n    } else {\n      return true;\n    }\n  },\n\n  // Optional only regex - if any filenames **don't** match this regex then they\n  // aren't compiled\n  only: /my_es6_folder/,\n\n  // Setting this will remove the currently hooked extensions of .es6, `.es`, `.jsx`\n  // and .js so you'll have to add them back if you want them to be used again.\n  extensions: [\".es6\", \".es\", \".jsx\", \".js\"],\n\n  // Setting this to false will disable the cache.\n  cache: true\n});\n```\n\nYou can pass in all other [options](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/api/#options) as well,\nincluding `plugins` and `presets`. But note that the closest [`.babelrc`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/)\nto each file still applies, and takes precedence over any options you pass in here.\n\n## Environment variables\n\nBy default `babel-node` and `babel-register` will save to a json cache in your\ntemporary directory.\n\nThis will heavily improve with the startup and compilation of your files. There\nare however scenarios where you want to change this behaviour and there are\nenvironment variables exposed to allow you to do this.\n\n### BABEL_CACHE_PATH\n\nSpecify a different cache location.\n\n```sh\nBABEL_CACHE_PATH=/foo/my-cache.json babel-node script.js\n```\n\n### BABEL_DISABLE_CACHE\n\nDisable the cache.\n\n```sh\nBABEL_DISABLE_CACHE=1 babel-node script.js\n```",

A given Package may consist of either the Standard\n    Version, or a Modified Version.\n\n    \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\n    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\n    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n\n    \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing\n    this Package or providing support for this Package to another\n    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.\n\n    \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been\n    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\n    by the Copyright Holder.\n\n    \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and\n    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\n    Holder.\n\n    \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with\n    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as\n    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n\n    \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\n    configuration files for the Package.\n\n    \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,\n    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or\n    translation of the Source form.\n\n\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n\n(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\nModified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\nyou do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n\n\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n\n(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\nStandard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\neither gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\nall of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At\nyour discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\nCompiled form of the Package.\n\n(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\nmodifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\nPackage will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\nwill be subject to the Original License.\n\n\nDistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n\n(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\nor for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\nModified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\nfrom the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\nany non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\nyou do at least ONE of the following:\n\n    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\n    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\n    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\n    Version.\n\n    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\n    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\n    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\n    from the name of the Standard Version.\n\n    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\n    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\n    under\n\n        (i)  the Original License or\n\n        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\n        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\n        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\n        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\n        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\n        Fees are allowed.\n\n\nDistribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\nor Modified Versions without the Source\n\n(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\nthe Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\nget the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\nvalid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\ntime while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\nmust provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\nIf you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\ndays after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\nyou do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n\n(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\nthe Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\nthe Source of the Modified Version.\n\n\nAggregating or Linking the Package\n\n(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\nModified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\naggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\nPackage.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\ncomponents in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\napply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\nas included in the aggregation.\n\n(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\nother works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\nbuild stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\ninclude the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\nprovided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n\n\nItems That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n\n(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\nmerely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\nthe Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\nconsidered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\nterms of this license.\n\n\nGeneral Provisions\n\n(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\nModified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\nmodifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\nuse, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\nlicense.\n\n(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\nVersion made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\nto ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\nthis license.\n\n(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\nservice mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n\n(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\nfree-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\nsell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\npatent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\ninfringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\nthat the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\ninfringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\ndate that such litigation is filed.\n\n(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\nTHE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\nIS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR\nNON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL\nLAW.

Here\nis the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:\n\n* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on\n  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs\n* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or\n  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations\n  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be\n  added to the result to make it positive\n\n### Postfixes\n\nThe only available postfix at the moment is:\n\n* `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript\n  Number. Decimals are not supported.\n\n### Examples\n\n* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`\n* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value\n* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13\n\n## Instructions\n\nPrefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be\neither `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).\n\n### Utilities\n\n* `a.clone()` - clone number\n* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes\n* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)\n* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)\n* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero\n  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding\n* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,\n  which must behave like an `Array`\n* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For\n  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:\n  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`\n* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied\n* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits\n  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)\n* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied\n* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative\n* `a.isEven()` - no comments\n* `a.isOdd()` - no comments\n* `a.isZero()` - no comments\n* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)\n  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)\n* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width\n* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width\n* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance\n\n### Arithmetics\n\n* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)\n* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)\n* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)\n* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`\n* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)\n* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)\n* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division\n\n### Bit operations\n\n* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced\n  with `andn` in future)\n* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`\n* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set\n* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)\n* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number\n* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)\n\n### Reduction\n\n* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD\n* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)\n* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`\n\n## Fast reduction\n\nWhen doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to\nuse some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm\nfor [Mersenne Prime][1].\n\n### Reduction context\n\nTo enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(num);\n```\nwhere `num` is just a BN instance.\n\nOr:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(primeName);\n```\n\nWhere `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:\n\n* `'k256'`\n* `'p224'`\n* `'p192'`\n* `'p25519'`\n\nOr:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.mont(num);\n```\n\nTo reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than\n`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.\n\n### Converting numbers\n\nBefore performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted\nto it. Usually, this means that one should:\n\n* Convert inputs to reducted ones\n* Operate on them in reduction context\n* Convert outputs back from the reduction context\n\nHere is how one may convert numbers to `red`:\n\n```js\nvar redA = a.toRed(red);\n```\nWhere `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above\n\nHere is how to convert them back:\n\n```js\nvar a = redA.fromRed();\n```\n\n### Red instructions\n\nMost of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their\ncounterparts in red context:\n\n* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`\n* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`\n* `a.redShl(num)`\n* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`\n* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`\n* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime\n* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number\n* `a.redNeg()`\n* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.",

Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material.

The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with\nimplementations like `kqueue` available on most \\*nix platforms. Chokidar still\ndoes have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.\n\nOn other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which\navoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate\nwatchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been\nspecified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much\nmore than needed.\n\n## Getting started\nInstall with npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install chokidar\n```\n\nThen `require` and use it in your code:\n\n```javascript\nvar chokidar = require('chokidar');\n\n// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles\nchokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {\n  console.log(event, path);\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a more typical implementation structure:\n\n// Initialize watcher.\nvar watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {\n  ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../,\n  persistent: true\n});\n\n// Something to use when events are received.\nvar log = console.log.bind(console);\n// Add event listeners.\nwatcher\n  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))\n  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));\n\n// More possible events.\nwatcher\n  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))\n  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))\n  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))\n  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {\n    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);\n  });\n\n// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second\n// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats\nwatcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {\n  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);\n});\n\n// Watch new files.\nwatcher.add('new-file');\nwatcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);\n\n// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem\nvar watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();\n\n// Un-watch some files.\nwatcher.unwatch('new-file*');\n\n// Stop watching.\nwatcher.close();\n\n// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)\nchokidar.watch('file', {\n  persistent: true,\n\n  ignored: '*.txt',\n  ignoreInitial: false,\n  followSymlinks: true,\n  cwd: '.',\n  disableGlobbing: false,\n\n  usePolling: true,\n  interval: 100,\n  binaryInterval: 300,\n  alwaysStat: false,\n  depth: 99,\n  awaitWriteFinish: {\n    stabilityThreshold: 2000,\n    pollInterval: 100\n  },\n\n  ignorePermissionErrors: false,\n  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)\n});\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`\n\n* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched\nrecursively, or glob patterns.\n* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:\n\n#### Persistence\n\n* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process\nshould continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to\n`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted\nafter `ready`, even if the process continues to run.\n\n#### Path filtering\n\n* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)\nDefines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is\ntested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it\ngets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second\ntime with two arguments (the path and the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject of that path).\n* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while\ninstantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).\n* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the\nsymlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following\nthe link references and bubbling events through the link's path.\n* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be\nderived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.\n* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as\nliteral path names, even if they look like globs.\n\n#### Performance\n\n* `usePolling` (default: `false`).\nWhether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling\nleads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is\ntypically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over\na network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other\nnon-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the\n`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable\nto true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.\n* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)\n  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also\n    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.\n  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system\n  polling for binary files.\n  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))\n* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the\n`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly\nand `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When\nset to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.\n* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set\nthis to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't\nalready available from the underlying watch events.\n* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of\nsubdirectories will be traversed.\n* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).\nBy default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before\nthe entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`\nevents will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,\nespecially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the\nwrite operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.\nSetting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,\nholding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a\nconfigurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily\ndependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should\nbe relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.\nUse with caution.\n  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust\n  timing params:*\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in\n  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.\n\n#### Errors\n* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files\nthat don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`\nor `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.\n* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).\nAutomatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use\n\"atomic writes\" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is\nre-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event\nrather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well\nfor you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in\nmilliseconds.\n\n### Methods & Events\n\n`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:\n\n* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.\nAvailable events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,\n`raw`, `error`.\nAdditionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event\nname and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.\n* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.\n* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file\nsystem being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the\ndirectories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the\nvalues are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.\n\n## CLI\n\nIf you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out\n[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to\nexecute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.\n\n## Install Troubleshooting\n\n* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`\n  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is\n    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,\n    Chokidar should function properly.\n\n* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable \"python\" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`\n  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:\n    `npm config set python python2.7`\n\n* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`\n  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2019 Paul Miller (https://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Replace swig with whatever templating you are using. For example, use cons.hogan for hogan.js, cons.jade for jade, etc. `console.log(cons)` for the full list of identifiers.\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate');\ncons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(html);\n});\n```\n\n  Or without options / local variables:\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate');\ncons.swig('views/page.html', function(err, html){\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(html);\n});\n```\n\n  To dynamically pass the engine, simply use the subscript operator and a variable:\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate')\n  , name = 'swig';\n\ncons[name]('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(html);\n});\n```\n\n### Promises\n\n  Additionally, all templates optionally return a promise if no callback function is provided. The promise represents the eventual result of the template function which will either resolve to a string, compiled from the template, or be rejected. Promises expose a `then` method which registers callbacks to receive the promise’s eventual value and a `catch` method which the reason why the promise could not be fulfilled. Promises allow more synchronous-like code structure and solve issues like race conditions.\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate');\n\ncons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' })\n  .then(function (html) {\n    console.log(html);\n  })\n  .catch(function (err) {\n    throw err;\n  });\n```\n\n## Caching\n\n To enable caching simply pass `{ cache: true }`. Engines _may_ use this option to cache things reading the file contents, compiled `Function`s etc. Engines which do _not_ support this may simply ignore it. All engines that consolidate.js implements I/O for will cache the file contents, ideal for production environments.\n When using consolidate directly: `cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi', cache:true }, callback);`\n Using Express 3 or higher: `app.locals.cache = true` or set NODE_ENV to 'production' and Express will do this for you.\n\n## Express 3.x example\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express')\n  , cons = require('consolidate')\n  , app = express();\n\n// assign the swig engine to .html files\napp.engine('html', cons.swig);\n\n// set .html as the default extension\napp.set('view engine', 'html');\napp.set('views', __dirname + '/views');\n\nvar users = [];\nusers.push({ name: 'tobi' });\nusers.push({ name: 'loki' });\nusers.push({ name: 'jane' });\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res){\n  res.render('index', {\n    title: 'Consolidate.js'\n  });\n});\n\napp.get('/users', function(req, res){\n  res.render('users', {\n    title: 'Users',\n    users: users\n  });\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\nconsole.log('Express server listening on port 3000');\n```\n\n## Template Engine Instances\n\nTemplate engines are exposed via the `cons.requires` object, but they are not instantiated until you've called the `cons[engine].render()` method. You can instantiate them manually beforehand if you want to add filters, globals, mixins, or other engine features.\n\n```js\nvar cons = require('consolidate'),\n  nunjucks = require('nunjucks');\n\n// add nunjucks to requires so filters can be\n// added and the same instance will be used inside the render method\ncons.requires.nunjucks = nunjucks.configure();\n\ncons.requires.nunjucks.addFilter('foo', function () {\n  return 'bar';\n});\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n* If you're using Nunjucks, please take a look at the `exports.nunjucks.render` function in `lib.consolidate.js`.  You can pass your own engine/environment via `options.nunjucksEnv`, or if you want to support Express you can pass `options.settings.views`, or if you have another use case, pass `options.nunjucks` (see the code for more insight).\n* You can pass **partials** with `options.partials`\n* For using **template inheritance** with nunjucks, you can pass a loader\n  with `options.loader`.\n* To use **filters** with tinyliquid, use `options.filters` and specify an array of properties, each of which is a named filter function. A filter function takes a string as a parameter and returns a modified version of it.\n* To use **custom tags** with tinyliquid, use `options.customTags` to specify an array of tag functions that follow the tinyliquid [custom tag](https://github.com/leizongmin/tinyliquid/wiki/Custom-Tag) definition.\n* The default directory used with the **include** tag with tinyliquid is the current working directory. To override this, use `options.includeDir`.\n* `React` To render content into a html base template (eg. `index.html` of your React app), pass the path of the template with `options.base`.\n\n## Running tests\n\n  Install dev deps:\n\n    $ npm install -d\n\n  Run the tests:\n\n    $ make test\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011-2016 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

Any localisation will happen by prefixing a sanitised version of `sourcePath` When dependencies are found, it will ask the `pathFetcher` for each dependency, resolve & inline any imports, and return the following object:\n\n- `injectableSource`: the final, merged CSS file without `@import` or `:import` statements\n- `exportTokens`: the mapping from local name to scoped name, as described in the file's `:export` block\n\nThese should map nicely to what your build-tool-specific loader needs to do its job.\n\n### new Core([plugins])\n\nThe default set of plugins is [[postcss-modules-local-by-default](https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules-local-by-default), [postcss-modules-extract-imports](https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules-extract-imports), [postcss-modules-scope](https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope)] (i.e. the CSS Modules specification). This can override which PostCSS plugins you wish to execute, e.g.\n\n```js\nimport Core from 'css-loader-core'\nimport autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer'\nimport colorFunctions from 'postcss-color-function'\n\n// Don't run local-by-default, but use colorFunctions \n// beforehand and autoprefixer afterwards:\nlet core = new Core([\n  colorFunctions, \n  core.plugins.extractImports, \n  core.plugins.scope, \n  autoprefixer(\"Last 2 Versions\")\n])\n```",

I made it so that when using [jQuery in node](https://github.com/tmtk75/node-jquery) setting css attributes via $.fn.css() would work. node-jquery uses [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) to create a DOM to use in node. jsdom uses CSSOM for styling, and CSSOM's implementation of the [CSSStyleDeclaration](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSStyleDeclaration) doesn't support [CSS2Properties](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties), which is how jQuery's [$.fn.css()](http://api.jquery.com/css/) operates.\n\n### Why not just issue a pull request?\n\nWell, NV wants to keep CSSOM fast (which I can appreciate) and CSS2Properties aren't required by the standard (though every browser has the interface). So I figured the path of least resistance would be to just modify this one class, publish it as a node module (that requires CSSOM) and then make a pull request of jsdom to use it.\n\n### How do I test this code?\n\n`npm test` should do the trick, assuming you have the dev dependencies installed:\n\n```\n$ npm test\n\ntests\n✔ Verify Has Properties\n✔ Verify Has Functions\n✔ Verify Has Special Properties\n✔ Test From Style String\n✔ Test From Properties\n✔ Test Shorthand Properties\n✔ Test width and height Properties and null and empty strings\n✔ Test Implicit Properties\n```",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Most of\nthe curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective\nor extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.\n\nAll operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is\nprovided by [hash.js][2]\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both\n  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for\n  node)\n\n#### LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2014.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.\n\n**By errno:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').errno[3]\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 3,\n//     \"code\": \"EACCES\",\n//     \"description\": \"permission denied\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**By code:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 53,\n//     \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n//     \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**Make your errors more descriptive:**\n\n```js\nvar errno = require('errno')\n\nfunction errmsg(err) {\n  var str = 'Error: '\n  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno\n  if (errno.errno[err.errno])\n    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description\n  else\n    str += err.message\n\n  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property\n  if (err.path)\n    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'\n\n  return str\n}\n\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nfs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {\n  if (err)\n    console.log(errmsg(err))\n})\n```\n\n**Use as a command line tool:**\n\n```\n~ $ errno 53\n{\n  \"errno\": 53,\n  \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n  \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n}\n~ $ errno EROFS\n{\n  \"errno\": 56,\n  \"code\": \"EROFS\",\n  \"description\": \"read-only file system\"\n}\n~ $ errno foo\nNo such errno/code: \"foo\"\n```\n\nSupply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.\n\nYou will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.\n\n<a name=\"customerrors\"></a>\n## Custom errors\n\nUse `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.\n\n```js\nvar create = require('errno').custom.createError\nvar MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error\nvar SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError\nvar OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)\n\n// use them!\nif (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')\n\nif (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))\n```\n\nAlso available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {\n  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))\n  // do something else\n})\n```\n\nThe resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI\n* [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)\n\n## Copyright & Licence\n\n*Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*\n\nMade available under the MIT licence:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished\nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If the\nterms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\nmake of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\na different licensing arrangement.\n\nDefinitions\n\n    \"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s)\n    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n\n    \"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other\n    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's\n    procedures.\n\n    \"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy,\n    distribute, or modify the Package.\n\n    \"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the\n    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of\n    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard\n    Version, or a Modified Version.\n\n    \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\n    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\n    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n\n    \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing\n    this Package or providing support for this Package to another\n    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.\n\n    \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been\n    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\n    by the Copyright Holder.\n\n    \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and\n    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\n    Holder.\n\n    \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with\n    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as\n    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n\n    \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\n    configuration files for the Package.\n\n    \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,\n    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or\n    translation of the Source form.\n\n\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n\n(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\nModified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\nyou do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n\n\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n\n(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\nStandard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\neither gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\nall of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At\nyour discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\nCompiled form of the Package.\n\n(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\nmodifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\nPackage will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\nwill be subject to the Original License.\n\n\nDistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n\n(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\nor for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\nModified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\nfrom the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\nany non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\nyou do at least ONE of the following:\n\n    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\n    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\n    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\n    Version.\n\n    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\n    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\n    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\n    from the name of the Standard Version.\n\n    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\n    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\n    under\n\n        (i)  the Original License or\n\n        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\n        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\n        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\n        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\n        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\n        Fees are allowed.\n\n\nDistribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\nor Modified Versions without the Source\n\n(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\nthe Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\nget the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\nvalid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\ntime while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\nmust provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\nIf you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\ndays after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\nyou do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n\n(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\nthe Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\nthe Source of the Modified Version.\n\n\nAggregating or Linking the Package\n\n(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\nModified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\naggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\nPackage.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\ncomponents in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\napply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\nas included in the aggregation.\n\n(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\nother works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\nbuild stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\ninclude the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\nprovided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n\n\nItems That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n\n(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\nmerely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\nthe Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\nconsidered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\nterms of this license.\n\n\nGeneral Provisions\n\n(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\nModified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\nmodifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\nuse, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\nlicense.\n\n(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\nVersion made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\nto ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\nthis license.\n\n(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\nservice mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n\n(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\nfree-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\nsell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\npatent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\ninfringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\nthat the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\ninfringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\ndate that such litigation is filed.\n\n(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\nTHE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\nIS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR\nNON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL\nLAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL\nBE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\n\n\n--------",

    "licenseText": "# grapheme-breaker\nA JavaScript implementation of the Unicode grapheme cluster breaking algorithm ([UAX #29](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries))\n\n> It is important to recognize that what the user thinks of as a “character”—a basic unit of a writing system for a \n> language—may not be just a single Unicode code point. Instead, that basic unit may be made up of multiple Unicode \n> code points. To avoid ambiguity with the computer use of the term character, this is called a user-perceived character. \n> For example, “G” + acute-accent is a user-perceived character: users think of it as a single character, yet is actually \n> represented by two Unicode code points. These user-perceived characters are approximated by what is called a grapheme cluster, \n> which can be determined programmatically.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install via npm\n\n    npm install grapheme-breaker\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nvar GraphemeBreaker = require('grapheme-breaker');\n\n// break a string into an array of grapheme clusters\n\n\nGraphemeBreaker.break('Z͑ͫ̓ͪ̂ͫ̽͏̴̙̤̞͉͚̯̞̠͍A̴̵̜̰͔ͫ͗͢L̠ͨͧͩ͘G̴̻͈͍͔̹̑͗̎̅͛́Ǫ̵̹̻̝̳͂̌̌͘!͖̬̰̙̗̿̋ͥͥ̂ͣ̐́́͜͞') // => ['Z͑ͫ̓ͪ̂ͫ̽͏̴̙̤̞͉͚̯̞̠͍', 'A̴̵̜̰͔ͫ͗͢', 'L̠ͨͧͩ͘', 'G̴̻͈͍͔̹̑͗̎̅͛́', 'Ǫ̵̹̻̝̳͂̌̌͘', '!͖̬̰̙̗̿̋ͥͥ̂ͣ̐́́͜͞']\n\n\n// or just count the number of grapheme clusters in a string\n\n\nGraphemeBreaker.countBreaks('Z͑ͫ̓ͪ̂ͫ̽͏̴̙̤̞͉͚̯̞̠͍A̴̵̜̰͔ͫ͗͢L̠ͨͧͩ͘G̴̻͈͍͔̹̑͗̎̅͛́Ǫ̵̹̻̝̳͂̌̌͘!͖̬̰̙̗̿̋ͥͥ̂ͣ̐́́͜͞') // => 6\n\n\n// use nextBreak and previousBreak to get break points starting \n// from anywhere in the string\nGraphemeBreaker.nextBreak('😜🇺🇸👍', 3) // => 6\nGraphemeBreaker.previousBreak('😜🇺🇸👍', 3) // => 2\n```\n\n## Development Notes\n\nIn order to use the library, you shouldn't need to know this, but if you're interested in\ncontributing or fixing bugs, these things might be of interest.\n\n* The `src/classes.coffee` file is automatically generated from `GraphemeBreakProperty.txt` in the Unicode \n  database by `src/generate_data.coffee`. It should be rare that you need to run this, but\n  you may if, for instance, you want to change the Unicode version.\n  \n* You can run the tests using `npm test`. They are written using `mocha`, and generated from\n  `GraphemeBreakTest.txt` from the Unicode database, which is included in the repository for performance\n  reasons while running them.\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

    "licenseText": "# Can I cache this? [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pornel/http-cache-semantics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pornel/http-cache-semantics)\n\n`CachePolicy` tells when responses can be reused from a cache, taking into account [HTTP RFC 7234](http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) rules for user agents and shared caches. It's aware of many tricky details such as the `Vary` header, proxy revalidation, and authenticated responses.\n\n## Usage\n\nCacheability of an HTTP response depends on how it was requested, so both `request` and `response` are required to create the policy.\n\n```js\nconst policy = new CachePolicy(request, response, options);\n\nif (!policy.storable()) {\n    // throw the response away, it's not usable at all\n    return;\n}\n\n// Cache the data AND the policy object in your cache\n// (this is pseudocode, roll your own cache (lru-cache package works))\nletsPretendThisIsSomeCache.set(request.url, {policy, response}, policy.timeToLive());\n```\n\n```js\n// And later, when you receive a new request:\nconst {policy, response} = letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.get(newRequest.url);\n\n// It's not enough that it exists in the cache, it has to match the new request, too:\nif (policy && policy.satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)) {\n    // OK, the previous response can be used to respond to the `newRequest`.\n    // Response headers have to be updated, e.g. to add Age and remove uncacheable headers.\n    response.headers = policy.responseHeaders();\n    return response;\n}\n```\n\nIt may be surprising, but it's not enough for an HTTP response to be [fresh](#yo-fresh) to satisfy a request. It may need to match request headers specified in `Vary`. Even a matching fresh response may still not be usable if the new request restricted cacheability, etc.\n\nThe key method is `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)`, which checks whether the `newRequest` is compatible with the original request and whether all caching conditions are met.\n\n### Constructor options\n\nRequest and response must have a `headers` property with all header names in lower case. `url`, `status` and `method` are optional (defaults are any URL, status `200`, and `GET` method).\n\n```js\nconst request = {\n    url: '/',\n    method: 'GET',\n    headers: {\n        accept: '*/*',\n    },\n};\n\nconst response = {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: {\n        'cache-control': 'public, max-age=7234',\n    },\n};\n\nconst options = {\n    shared: true,\n    cacheHeuristic: 0.1,\n    immutableMinTimeToLive: 24*3600*1000, // 24h\n    ignoreCargoCult: false,\n};\n```\n\nIf `options.shared` is `true` (default), then the response is evaluated from a perspective of a shared cache (i.e. `private` is not cacheable and `s-maxage` is respected). If `options.shared` is `false`, then the response is evaluated from a perspective of a single-user cache (i.e. `private` is cacheable and `s-maxage` is ignored).\n\n`options.cacheHeuristic` is a fraction of response's age that is used as a fallback cache duration. The default is 0.1 (10%), e.g. if a file hasn't been modified for 100 days, it'll be cached for 100*0.1 = 10 days.\n\n`options.immutableMinTimeToLive` is a number of milliseconds to assume as the default time to cache responses with `Cache-Control: immutable`. Note that [per RFC](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/immutable.html) these can become stale, so `max-age` still overrides the default.\n\nIf `options.ignoreCargoCult` is true, common anti-cache directives will be completely ignored if the non-standard `pre-check` and `post-check` directives are present. These two useless directives are most commonly found in bad StackOverflow answers and PHP's \"session limiter\" defaults.\n\n### `storable()`\n\nReturns `true` if the response can be stored in a cache. If it's `false` then you MUST NOT store either the request or the response.\n\n### `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)`\n\nThis is the most important method. Use this method to check whether the cached response is still fresh in the context of the new request.\n\nIf it returns `true`, then the given `request` matches the original response this cache policy has been created with, and the response can be reused without contacting the server. Note that the old response can't be returned without being updated, see `responseHeaders()`.\n\nIf it returns `false`, then the response may not be matching at all (e.g. it's for a different URL or method), or may require to be refreshed first (see `revalidationHeaders()`).\n\n### `responseHeaders()`\n\nReturns updated, filtered set of response headers to return to clients receiving the cached response. This function is necessary, because proxies MUST always remove hop-by-hop headers (such as `TE` and `Connection`) and update response's `Age` to avoid doubling cache time.\n\n```js\ncachedResponse.headers = cachePolicy.responseHeaders(cachedResponse);\n```\n\n### `timeToLive()`\n\nReturns approximate time in *milliseconds* until the response becomes stale (i.e. not fresh).\n\nAfter that time (when `timeToLive() <= 0`) the response might not be usable without revalidation. However, there are exceptions, e.g. a client can explicitly allow stale responses, so always check with `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation()`.\n\n### `toObject()`/`fromObject(json)`\n\nChances are you'll want to store the `CachePolicy` object along with the cached response. `obj = policy.toObject()` gives a plain JSON-serializable object. `policy = CachePolicy.fromObject(obj)` creates an instance from it.\n\n### Refreshing stale cache (revalidation)\n\nWhen a cached response has expired, it can be made fresh again by making a request to the origin server. The server may respond with status 304 (Not Modified) without sending the response body again, saving bandwidth.\n\nThe following methods help perform the update efficiently and correctly.\n\n#### `revalidationHeaders(newRequest)`\n\nReturns updated, filtered set of request headers to send to the origin server to check if the cached response can be reused. These headers allow the origin server to return status 304 indicating the response is still fresh. All headers unrelated to caching are passed through as-is.\n\nUse this method when updating cache from the origin server.\n\n```js\nupdateRequest.headers = cachePolicy.revalidationHeaders(updateRequest);\n```\n\n#### `revalidatedPolicy(revalidationRequest, revalidationResponse)`\n\nUse this method to update the cache after receiving a new response from the origin server. It returns an object with two keys:\n\n* `policy` — A new `CachePolicy` with HTTP headers updated from `revalidationResponse`. You can always replace the old cached `CachePolicy` with the new one.\n* `modified` — Boolean indicating whether the response body has changed.\n   * If `false`, then a valid 304 Not Modified response has been received, and you can reuse the old cached response body.\n   * If `true`, you should use new response's body (if present), or make another request to the origin server without any conditional headers (i.e. don't use `revalidationHeaders()` this time) to get the new resource.\n\n```js\n// When serving requests from cache:\nconst {oldPolicy, oldResponse} = letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.get(newRequest.url);\n\nif (!oldPolicy.satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)) {\n    // Change the request to ask the origin server if the cached response can be used\n    newRequest.headers = oldPolicy.revalidationHeaders(newRequest);\n\n    // Send request to the origin server. The server may respond with status 304\n    const newResponse = await makeRequest(newResponse);\n\n    // Create updated policy and combined response from the old and new data\n    const {policy, modified} = oldPolicy.revalidatedPolicy(newRequest, newResponse);\n    const response = modified ? newResponse : oldResponse;\n\n    // Update the cache with the newer/fresher response\n    letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.set(newRequest.url, {policy, response}, policy.timeToLive());\n\n    // And proceed returning cached response as usual\n    response.headers = policy.responseHeaders();\n    return response;\n}\n```\n\n# Yo, FRESH\n\n![satisfiesWithoutRevalidation](fresh.jpg)\n\n## Used by\n\n* [ImageOptim API](https://imageoptim.com/api), [make-fetch-happen](https://github.com/zkat/make-fetch-happen), [cacheable-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cacheable-request), [npm/registry-fetch](https://github.com/npm/registry-fetch), [etc.](https://github.com/pornel/http-cache-semantics/network/dependents)\n\n## Implemented\n\n* `Cache-Control` response header with all the quirks.\n* `Expires` with check for bad clocks.\n* `Pragma` response header.\n* `Age` response header.\n* `Vary` response header.\n* Default cacheability of statuses and methods.\n* Requests for stale data.\n* Filtering of hop-by-hop headers.\n* Basic revalidation request\n\n## Unimplemented\n\n* Merging of range requests, If-Range (but correctly supports them as non-cacheable)\n* Revalidation of multiple representations",

This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling",

    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You want to make some light modifications to it - replacing a few characters here and there, wrapping it with a header and footer, etc - and ideally you'd like to generate a source map at the end of it. You've thought about using something like [recast](https://github.com/benjamn/recast) (which allows you to generate an AST from some JavaScript, manipulate it, and reprint it with a sourcemap without losing your comments and formatting), but it seems like overkill for your needs (or maybe the source code isn't JavaScript).\n\nYour requirements are, frankly, rather niche. But they're requirements that I also have, and for which I made magic-string. It's a small, fast utility for manipulating strings and generating sourcemaps.\n\n## Installation\n\nmagic-string works in both node.js and browser environments. For node, install with npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm i magic-string\n```\n\nTo use in browser, grab the [magic-string.umd.js](https://unpkg.com/magic-string/dist/magic-string.umd.js) file and add it to your page:\n\n```html\n<script src='magic-string.umd.js'></script>\n```\n\n(It also works with various module systems, if you prefer that sort of thing - it has a dependency on [vlq](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/vlq).)\n\n## Usage\n\nThese examples assume you're in node.js, or something similar:\n\n```js\nvar MagicString = require( 'magic-string' );\nvar s = new MagicString( 'problems = 99' );\n\ns.overwrite( 0, 8, 'answer' );\ns.toString(); // 'answer = 99'\n\ns.overwrite( 11, 13, '42' ); // character indices always refer to the original string\ns.toString(); // 'answer = 42'\n\ns.prepend( 'var ' ).append( ';' ); // most methods are chainable\ns.toString(); // 'var answer = 42;'\n\nvar map = s.generateMap({\n  source: 'source.js',\n  file: 'converted.js.map',\n  includeContent: true\n}); // generates a v3 sourcemap\n\nrequire( 'fs' ).writeFile( 'converted.js', s.toString() );\nrequire( 'fs' ).writeFile( 'converted.js.map', map.toString() );\n```\n\nYou can pass an options argument:\n\n```js\nvar s = new MagicString( someCode, {\n  // both these options will be used if you later\n  // call `bundle.addSource( s )` - see below\n  filename: 'foo.js',\n  indentExclusionRanges: [/*...*/]\n});\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n### s.addSourcemapLocation( index )\n\nAdds the specified character index (with respect to the original string) to sourcemap mappings, if `hires` is `false` (see below).\n\n### s.append( content )\n\nAppends the specified content to the end of the string. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.appendLeft( index, content )\n\nAppends the specified `content` at the `index` in the original string. If a range *ending* with `index` is subsequently moved, the insert will be moved with it. Returns `this`. See also `s.prependLeft(...)`.\n\n### s.appendRight( index, content )\n\nAppends the specified `content` at the `index` in the original string. If a range *starting* with `index` is subsequently moved, the insert will be moved with it. Returns `this`. See also `s.prependRight(...)`.\n\n### s.clone()\n\nDoes what you'd expect.\n\n### s.generateMap( options )\n\nGenerates a [version 3 sourcemap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit). All options are, well, optional:\n\n* `file` - the filename where you plan to write the sourcemap\n* `source` - the filename of the file containing the original source\n* `includeContent` - whether to include the original content in the map's `sourcesContent` array\n* `hires` - whether the mapping should be high-resolution. Hi-res mappings map every single character, meaning (for example) your devtools will always be able to pinpoint the exact location of function calls and so on. With lo-res mappings, devtools may only be able to identify the correct line - but they're quicker to generate and less bulky. If sourcemap locations have been specified with `s.addSourceMapLocation()`, they will be used here.\n\nThe returned sourcemap has two (non-enumerable) methods attached for convenience:\n\n* `toString` - returns the equivalent of `JSON.stringify(map)`\n* `toUrl` - returns a DataURI containing the sourcemap. Useful for doing this sort of thing:\n\n```js\ncode += '\\n//# sourceMappingURL=' + map.toUrl();\n```\n\n### s.indent( prefix[, options] )\n\nPrefixes each line of the string with `prefix`. If `prefix` is not supplied, the indentation will be guessed from the original content, falling back to a single tab character. Returns `this`.\n\nThe `options` argument can have an `exclude` property, which is an array of `[start, end]` character ranges. These ranges will be excluded from the indentation - useful for (e.g.) multiline strings.\n\n### s.insertLeft( index, content )\n\n**DEPRECATED** since 0.17 – use `s.appendLeft(...)` instead\n\n### s.insertRight( index, content )\n\n**DEPRECATED** since 0.17 – use `s.prependRight(...)` instead\n\n### s.locate( index )\n\n**DEPRECATED** since 0.10 – see [#30](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/magic-string/pull/30)\n\n### s.locateOrigin( index )\n\n**DEPRECATED** since 0.10 – see [#30](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/magic-string/pull/30)\n\n### s.move( start, end, newIndex )\n\nMoves the characters from `start` and `end` to `index`. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.overwrite( start, end, content[, options] )\n\nReplaces the characters from `start` to `end` with `content`. The same restrictions as `s.remove()` apply. Returns `this`.\n\nThe fourth argument is optional. It can have a `storeName` property — if `true`, the original name will be stored for later inclusion in a sourcemap's `names` array — and a `contentOnly` property which determines whether only the content is overwritten, or anything that was appended/prepended to the range as well.\n\n### s.prepend( content )\n\nPrepends the string with the specified content. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.prependLeft ( index, content )\n\nSame as `s.appendLeft(...)`, except that the inserted content will go *before* any previous appends or prepends at `index`\n\n### s.prependRight ( index, content )\n\nSame as `s.appendRight(...)`, except that the inserted content will go *before* any previous appends or prepends at `index`\n\n### s.remove( start, end )\n\nRemoves the characters from `start` to `end` (of the original string, **not** the generated string). Removing the same content twice, or making removals that partially overlap, will cause an error. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.slice( start, end )\n\nReturns the content of the generated string that corresponds to the slice between `start` and `end` of the original string. Throws error if the indices are for characters that were already removed.\n\n### s.snip( start, end )\n\nReturns a clone of `s`, with all content before the `start` and `end` characters of the original string removed.\n\n### s.toString()\n\nReturns the generated string.\n\n### s.trim([ charType ])\n\nTrims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the start and end. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.trimStart([ charType ])\n\nTrims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the start. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.trimEnd([ charType ])\n\nTrims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the end. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.trimLines()\n\nRemoves empty lines from the start and end. Returns `this`.\n\n## Bundling\n\nTo concatenate several sources, use `MagicString.Bundle`:\n\n```js\nvar bundle = new MagicString.Bundle();\n\nbundle.addSource({\n  filename: 'foo.js',\n  content: new MagicString( 'var answer = 42;' )\n});\n\nbundle.addSource({\n  filename: 'bar.js',\n  content: new MagicString( 'console.log( answer )' )\n});\n\n// Advanced: a source can include an `indentExclusionRanges` property\n// alongside `filename` and `content`. This will be passed to `s.indent()`\n// - see documentation above\n\nbundle.indent() // optionally, pass an indent string, otherwise it will be guessed\n  .prepend( '(function () {\\n' )\n  .append( '}());' );\n\nbundle.toString();\n// (function () {\n//   var answer = 42;\n//   console.log( answer );\n// }());\n\n// options are as per `s.generateMap()` above\nvar map = bundle.generateMap({\n  file: 'bundle.js',\n  includeContent: true,\n  hires: true\n});\n```\n\nAs an alternative syntax, if you a) don't have `filename` or `indentExclusionRanges` options, or b) passed those in when you used `new MagicString(...)`, you can simply pass the `MagicString` instance itself:\n\n```js\nvar bundle = new MagicString.Bundle();\nvar source = new MagicString( someCode, {\n  filename: 'foo.js'\n});\n\nbundle.addSource( source );\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,\nnon transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in\nthe Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\nprovided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\nin any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\npurpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\npromotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\n  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,\n  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or\n  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not\n  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation\n  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer\n  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions\n  or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n\n  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n  CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\n<http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>",

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

If the\nterms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\nmake of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\na different licensing arrangement.\n\nDefinitions\n\n    \"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s)\n    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n\n    \"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other\n    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's\n    procedures.\n\n    \"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy,\n    distribute, or modify the Package.\n\n    \"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the\n    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of\n    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard\n    Version, or a Modified Version.\n\n    \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\n    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\n    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n\n    \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing\n    this Package or providing support for this Package to another\n    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.\n\n    \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been\n    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\n    by the Copyright Holder.\n\n    \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and\n    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\n    Holder.\n\n    \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with\n    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as\n    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n\n    \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\n    configuration files for the Package.\n\n    \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,\n    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or\n    translation of the Source form.\n\n\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n\n(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\nModified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\nyou do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n\n\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n\n(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\nStandard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\neither gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\nall of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At\nyour discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\nCompiled form of the Package.\n\n(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\nmodifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\nPackage will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\nwill be subject to the Original License.\n\n\nDistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n\n(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\nor for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\nModified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\nfrom the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\nany non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\nyou do at least ONE of the following:\n\n    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\n    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\n    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\n    Version.\n\n    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\n    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\n    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\n    from the name of the Standard Version.\n\n    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\n    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\n    under\n\n        (i)  the Original License or\n\n        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\n        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\n        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\n        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\n        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\n        Fees are allowed.\n\n\nDistribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\nor Modified Versions without the Source\n\n(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\nthe Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\nget the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\nvalid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\ntime while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\nmust provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\nIf you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\ndays after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\nyou do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n\n(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\nthe Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\nthe Source of the Modified Version.\n\n\nAggregating or Linking the Package\n\n(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\nModified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\naggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\nPackage.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\ncomponents in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\napply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\nas included in the aggregation.\n\n(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\nother works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\nbuild stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\ninclude the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\nprovided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n\n\nItems That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n\n(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\nmerely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\nthe Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\nconsidered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\nterms of this license.\n\n\nGeneral Provisions\n\n(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\nModified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\nmodifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\nuse, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\nlicense.\n\n(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\nVersion made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\nto ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\nthis license.\n\n(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\nservice mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n\n(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\nfree-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\nsell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\npatent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\ninfringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\nthat the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\ninfringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\ndate that such litigation is filed.\n\n(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\nTHE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\nIS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR\nNON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL\nLAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL\nBE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\n\n\n--------",

It does not mean licensing fees.\n\n    \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been\n    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\n    by the Copyright Holder.\n\n    \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and\n    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\n    Holder.\n\n    \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with\n    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as\n    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n\n    \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\n    configuration files for the Package.\n\n    \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,\n    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or\n    translation of the Source form.\n\n\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n\n(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\nModified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\nyou do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n\n\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n\n(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\nStandard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\neither gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\nall of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At\nyour discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\nCompiled form of the Package.\n\n(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\nmodifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\nPackage will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\nwill be subject to the Original License.\n\n\nDistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n\n(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\nor for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\nModified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\nfrom the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\nany non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\nyou do at least ONE of the following:\n\n    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\n    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\n    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\n    Version.\n\n    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\n    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\n    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\n    from the name of the Standard Version.\n\n    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\n    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\n    under\n\n        (i)  the Original License or\n\n        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\n        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\n        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\n        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\n        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\n        Fees are allowed.\n\n\nDistribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\nor Modified Versions without the Source\n\n(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\nthe Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\nget the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\nvalid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\ntime while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\nmust provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\nIf you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\ndays after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\nyou do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n\n(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\nthe Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\nthe Source of the Modified Version.\n\n\nAggregating or Linking the Package\n\n(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\nModified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\naggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\nPackage.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\ncomponents in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\napply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\nas included in the aggregation.\n\n(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\nother works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\nbuild stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\ninclude the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\nprovided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n\n\nItems That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n\n(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\nmerely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\nthe Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\nconsidered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\nterms of this license.\n\n\nGeneral Provisions\n\n(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\nModified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\nmodifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\nuse, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\nlicense.\n\n(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\nVersion made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\nto ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\nthis license.\n\n(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\nservice mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n\n(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\nfree-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\nsell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\npatent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\ninfringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\nthat the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\ninfringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\ndate that such litigation is filed.\n\n(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\nTHE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\nIS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.

For some workloads this can negatively impact performance on CPUs that use simultaneous multithreading (SMT). Latency is doubled because two processes share the same physical CPU core to get their work done. Additionally there is memory spent for each running worker, as well as time to spawn their processes. It is better to fork no more child processes than there are physical cores.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\nImplemented for Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n\nOther platforms use a naive approach that only looks at Intel CPUs, and assumes every Intel CPU supports, and has enabled, Hyper-Threading with two threads per physical core. These assumptions are not always correct.\n\nPower management might also make CPU cores unavailable.\n\n## See also:\n\n- [Issue `nodejs/node#7730` to implement physical core detection natively in Node.js.](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7730)\n- [Relevant Stack Overflow answer for macOS and Linux.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23378780)\n- [Solutions for Windows WMIC from the command prompt.](http://superuser.com/questions/226552/how-to-tell-how-many-cpus-cores-you-have-on-windows-7)",

    "description": "Promisify the node standard library.",
    "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2014-2018 C. Scott Ananian",
    "licenseFile": "node_modules/pn/README.md",
    "licenseText": "# pn\n[![NPM][NPM1]][NPM2]\n\n[![Build Status][1]][2]\n\nThe `pn` library gives you the Promise-using node standard library\nyou've always dreamed of.  Think \"Promised Node\" when saying it.\n\nJust about every node standard library method that takes a callback will now\nreturn a `Promise` iff no callback is supplied.  But existing code\nthat passes callbacks will still work fine --- and fast:  No unnecessary\n`Promise`s are created if you supply a callback.\n\nThe wrappers are generated automatically by a script, with a table to\nhandle exceptions and odd cases.  See below for more details.\n\n## Installation\n```\nnpm install pn\n```\n## Usage\n```\nvar fs = require('pn/fs');\nfs.writeFile('foo', 'bar', 'utf-8').then(function() { console.log('done'); });\n// But you can use callbacks, too -- existing code won't break.\nfs.writeFile('foo', 'bat', 'utf-8', function(err) { console.log('yay'); });\n```\n\nThis library uses node native promises (ie `global.Promise`) by\ndefault, and thus works with node >= 0.11.\n\nYou can use [`core-js`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/core-js) or\n[`es6-shim`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/es6-shim)\nto add ES6 Promises to earlier versions of node, for example:\n```\nrequire('es6-shim');\nvar fs = require('pn/fs');\n```\nJust be sure that `es6-shim` is loaded before the `pn` package in that\ncase.\n\nYou might also want to look into packages like\n[`prfun`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/prfun)\nwhich add some helpers to make working with native promises much more\nfun.\n\nIn particular, the `Promise#done` method is very useful when\ndebugging, at least until v8's native Promise debugging\ncapabilities are completed.\n\n## Custom Promise types\n\nYou can also specify a custom `Promise` type to use, as follows:\n```\nvar MyPromise = require('prfun');  // Use prfun's Promises, for example.\nrequire('pn/_promise')(MyPromise); // This only needs to be done once.\n```\n\n## Exceptions and odd cases\n\nThe wrappers are automatically generated by `scripts/generate.js`;\nthere is a table in that file which specifies all the odd cases.\n\nIn general: if the node API has a callback which takes multiple\nvalue arguments, the `Promise` returned will be an object with\nnamed fields corresponding to the different values. If the node\nAPI takes a callback *and* returns a value, `pn` will return\nthe original value with a nonenumerable field named `promise`\ncorresponding to the callback.  Combining these two cases:\n```\nvar child_process = require('pn/child_process');\nvar cp = child_process.execFile('true');\nconsole.log('pid', cp.pid);\ncp.promise.then(function(result) {\n  console.log('stdout: ', result.stdout);\n  console.log('stderr: ', result.stderr);\n});\n```\n\n* `child_process`: The `exec` and `execFile` methods promise a object\n  with fields named `stdout` and `stderr`.  They return a `ChildProcess`\n  object with a nonenumerable field named `promise` corresponding to the\n  callback.\n* `crypto`: The `randomBytes` and `pseudoRandomBytes` methods are\n  now always asynchronous, returning a `Promise` if no callback\n  is supplied.  Use the new `randomBytesSync` and `pseudoRandomBytesSync`\n  methods if you want synchronous computation.  *This is backwards\n  incompatible with existing node code.*\n* `dns`: The `lookupService` method promises an object with\n  fields named `hostname` and `service`.\n* `fs`: The `exists` method doesn't pass an error to its callback.\n  The promisied version will never reject.  The `write` method promises\n  an object with fields named `written` and `data`.  The `read` method\n  promises an object with fields named `read` and `data`.\n* `http`, `https`: The `request` and `get` methods return a `ClientRequest`\n  object with a nonenumerable field named `promise`, which will\n  resolve to an `IncomingMessage` object.\n* `process`: You can defer computation to the next tick with\n  `require('pn/process').nextTick().then(function(){...})`\n* `tls`: The `connect` and `createServer` return objects with a\n  nonenumerable field named `promise`.\n\nThere are a few object methods which are not promisified by this\npackage:\n* `domain`: `Domain#bind`, `Domain#intercept`\n* `http`,`https`: `ClientRequest#setTimeout`, `IncomingMessage#setTimeout`,\n  `Server#setTimeout`, `ServerResponse#setTimeout`, `Server#listen`,\n  `Server#close`\n* `net`: `Server#listen`, `Server#close`, `Server#getConnections`,\n  `Socket#write`, `Socket#setTimeout`\n* `readline`: `Interface#question`\n* `stream`: `Writable#write`, `Writable#end`\n* `dgram`: `Socket#send`, `Socket#bind`.\n\n## Related packages\n\nHere are some other packages with similar aims:\n* [`promised-node`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/promised-node)\n* [`then-fs`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/then-fs)\n* [`final-fs`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/final-fs)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2014-2018 C.

It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.\n\n### Input\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```js\nfoo(reallyLongArg(), omgSoManyParameters(), IShouldRefactorThis(), isThereSeriouslyAnotherOne());\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```js\nfoo(\n  reallyLongArg(),\n  omgSoManyParameters(),\n  IShouldRefactorThis(),\n  isThereSeriouslyAnotherOne()\n);\n```\n\nPrettier can be run [in your editor](http://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) on-save, in a [pre-commit hook](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html), or in [CI environments](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html#list-different) to ensure your codebase has a consistent style without devs ever having to post a nit-picky comment on a code review ever again!\n\n---\n\n**[Documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/)**\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n[Install](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) ·\n[Options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) ·\n[CLI](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html) ·\n[API](https://prettier.io/docs/en/api.html)\n\n**[Playground](https://prettier.io/playground/)**\n\n---\n\n## Badge\n\nShow the world you're using _Prettier_ → [![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)\n\n```md\n[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).",

It is available for use in any software,\nbut was originally created to meet the needs of browser manufacturers.\n\nA \"public suffix\" is one under which Internet users can directly register names.\nSome examples of public suffixes are \".com\", \".co.uk\" and \"pvt.k12.wy.us\". The\nPublic Suffix List is a list of all known public suffixes.\n\nSource: http://publicsuffix.org\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Node.js\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save psl\n```\n\n### Browser\n\nDownload [psl.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wrangr/psl/master/dist/psl.min.js)\nand include it in a script tag.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"psl.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThis script is browserified and wrapped in a [umd](https://github.com/umdjs/umd)\nwrapper so you should be able to use it standalone or together with a module\nloader.\n\n## API\n\n### `psl.parse(domain)`\n\nParse domain based on Public Suffix List. Returns an `Object` with the following\nproperties:\n\n* `tld`: Top level domain (this is the _public suffix_).\n* `sld`: Second level domain (the first private part of the domain name).\n* `domain`: The domain name is the `sld` + `tld`.\n* `subdomain`: Optional parts left of the domain.\n\n#### Example:\n\n```js\nvar psl = require('psl');\n\n// Parse domain without subdomain\nvar parsed = psl.parse('google.com');\nconsole.log(parsed.tld); // 'com'\nconsole.log(parsed.sld); // 'google'\nconsole.log(parsed.domain); // 'google.com'\nconsole.log(parsed.subdomain); // null\n\n// Parse domain with subdomain\nvar parsed = psl.parse('www.google.com');\nconsole.log(parsed.tld); // 'com'\nconsole.log(parsed.sld); // 'google'\nconsole.log(parsed.domain); // 'google.com'\nconsole.log(parsed.subdomain); // 'www'\n\n// Parse domain with nested subdomains\nvar parsed = psl.parse('a.b.c.d.foo.com');\nconsole.log(parsed.tld); // 'com'\nconsole.log(parsed.sld); // 'foo'\nconsole.log(parsed.domain); // 'foo.com'\nconsole.log(parsed.subdomain); // 'a.b.c.d'\n```\n\n### `psl.get(domain)`\n\nGet domain name, `sld` + `tld`. Returns `null` if not valid.\n\n#### Example:\n\n```js\nvar psl = require('psl');\n\n// null input.\npsl.get(null); // null\n\n// Mixed case.\npsl.get('COM'); // null\npsl.get('example.COM'); // 'example.com'\npsl.get('WwW.example.COM'); // 'example.com'\n\n// Unlisted TLD.\npsl.get('example'); // null\npsl.get('example.example'); // 'example.example'\npsl.get('b.example.example'); // 'example.example'\npsl.get('a.b.example.example'); // 'example.example'\n\n// TLD with only 1 rule.\npsl.get('biz'); // null\npsl.get('domain.biz'); // 'domain.biz'\npsl.get('b.domain.biz'); // 'domain.biz'\npsl.get('a.b.domain.biz'); // 'domain.biz'\n\n// TLD with some 2-level rules.\npsl.get('uk.com'); // null);\npsl.get('example.uk.com'); // 'example.uk.com');\npsl.get('b.example.uk.com'); // 'example.uk.com');\n\n// More complex TLD.\npsl.get('c.kobe.jp'); // null\npsl.get('b.c.kobe.jp'); // 'b.c.kobe.jp'\npsl.get('a.b.c.kobe.jp'); // 'b.c.kobe.jp'\npsl.get('city.kobe.jp'); // 'city.kobe.jp'\npsl.get('www.city.kobe.jp'); // 'city.kobe.jp'\n\n// IDN labels.\npsl.get('食狮.com.cn'); // '食狮.com.cn'\npsl.get('食狮.公司.cn'); // '食狮.公司.cn'\npsl.get('www.食狮.公司.cn'); // '食狮.公司.cn'\n\n// Same as above, but punycoded.\npsl.get('xn--85x722f.com.cn'); // 'xn--85x722f.com.cn'\npsl.get('xn--85x722f.xn--55qx5d.cn'); // 'xn--85x722f.xn--55qx5d.cn'\npsl.get('www.xn--85x722f.xn--55qx5d.cn'); // 'xn--85x722f.xn--55qx5d.cn'\n```\n\n### `psl.isValid(domain)`\n\nCheck whether a domain has a valid Public Suffix. Returns a `Boolean` indicating\nwhether the domain has a valid Public Suffix.\n\n#### Example\n\n```js\nvar psl = require('psl');\n\npsl.isValid('google.com'); // true\npsl.isValid('www.google.com'); // true\npsl.isValid('x.yz'); // false\n```\n\n\n## Testing and Building\n\nTest are written using [`mocha`](https://mochajs.org/) and can be\nrun in two different environments: `node` and `phantomjs`.\n\n```sh\n# This will run `eslint`, `mocha` and `karma`.\nnpm test\n\n# Individual test environments\n# Run tests in node only.\n./node_modules/.bin/mocha test\n# Run tests in phantomjs only.\n./node_modules/.bin/karma start ./karma.conf.js --single-run\n\n# Build data (parse raw list) and create dist files\nnpm run build\n```\n\nFeel free to fork if you see possible improvements!\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* Mozilla Foundation's [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/)\n* Thanks to Rob Stradling of [Comodo](https://www.comodo.com/) for providing\n  test data.\n* Inspired by [weppos/publicsuffix-ruby](https://github.com/weppos/publicsuffix-ruby)\n\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Lupo Montero <lupomontero@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

    "licenseText": "# run-queue\n\nA promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with concurrency limiting.\n\n```js\nconst RunQueue = require('run-queue')\n\nconst queue = new RunQueue({\n  maxConcurrency: 1\n})\n\nqueue.add(1, example, [-1])\nfor (let ii = 0; ii < 5; ++ii) {\n  queue.add(0, example, [ii])\n}\nconst finished = []\nqueue.run().then(\n  console.log(finished)\n})\n\nfunction example (num, next) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    finished.push(num)\n    next()\n  }, 5 - Math.abs(num))\n}\n```\n\nwould output\n\n```\n[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ]\n```\n\nIf you bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:\n\n```\n[ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ]\n```\n\nThe concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take\nlonger than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the\nnext priority level is run.  See\n[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is\neven true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue\ncan execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:\n\n```\n[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]\n```\n\n## API\n\n### const queue = new RunQueue(options)\n\nCreate a new queue. Options may contain:\n\n* maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.\n* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.\n\n### queue.add (prio, fn, args)\n\nAdd a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`\nwith `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.\n\n### queue.run ()\n\nStart running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either\nall the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a\nrejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected\nwith that error and no further queue running will be done.\n\n## PRIORITIES\n\nPriorities are any integer value >= 0.\n\nLowest is executed first.\n\nPriorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue\nmust complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.\n\nThis means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`\nmust complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs\nwhile `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`\nqueue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs\ncomplete.",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

See the \"Examples\" section below.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install socks-proxy-agent\n```\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n#### `http` module example\n\n``` js\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');\n\n// SOCKS proxy to connect to\nvar proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050';\nconsole.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);\n\n// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to\nvar endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nconsole.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);\nvar opts = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information\nvar agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);\nopts.agent = agent;\n\nhttp.get(opts, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\n#### `https` module example\n\n``` js\nvar url = require('url');\nvar https = require('https');\nvar SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');\n\n// SOCKS proxy to connect to\nvar proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050';\nconsole.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);\n\n// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to\nvar endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/';\nconsole.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);\nvar opts = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information\nvar agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);\nopts.agent = agent;\n\nhttps.get(opts, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\n#### `ws` WebSocket connection example\n\n``` js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');\n\n// SOCKS proxy to connect to\nvar proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050';\nconsole.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);\n\n// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to\nvar endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';\nconsole.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);\n\n// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information\nvar agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);\n\n// initiate the WebSocket connection\nvar socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });\n\nsocket.on('open', function () {\n  console.log('\"open\" event!');\n  socket.send('hello world');\n});\n\nsocket.on('message', function (data, flags) {\n  console.log('\"message\" event! %j %j', data, flags);\n  socket.close();\n});\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

According to the spec, source maps have the\nfollowing attributes:\n\n* `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.\n\n* `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.\n\n* `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual\n  mappings.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.\n\n* `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.\n\n* `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.\n\n* `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()\n\nCompute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is\ninclusive.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)\n\nReturns the original source, line, and column information for the generated\nsource's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source.\n\n* `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest\n  element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,\n  respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.  Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND`.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not\n  available.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is\n  not available.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this\n  information is not available.\n\n* `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns the generated line and column information for the original source,\nline, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns all generated line and column information for the original source, line,\nand column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings\ncorresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line\nthat has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the\ngiven line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column\nthat has any offsets.\n\nThe only argument is an object with the following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.\n\n* `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source.\n\nand an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()\n\nReturn true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in\nthe source map, false otherwise.\n\nIn other words, if this method returns `true`, then `smc.sourceContentFor(s)`\nwill succeed for every source `s` in `smc.sources`.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])\n\nReturns the original source content for the source provided. The only\nargument is the URL of the original source file.\n\nIf the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is\nthrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned\ninstead.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)\n\nIterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a\ngenerated line/column in this source map.\n\n* `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the\n  form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,\n  name }`\n\n* `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`\n  every time that `callback` is called.\n\n* `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over\n  the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the\n  original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.\n\n### SourceMapGenerator\n\nAn instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being\nbuilt incrementally.\n\n#### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])\n\nYou may pass an object with the following properties:\n\n* `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is\n  associated with.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.\n\n* `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as\n  they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with\n  discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when\n  running tests, if possible.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)\n\nCreates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)\n\nAdd a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated\nsource's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object\nshould have the following properties:\n\n* `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.\n\n* `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.\n\n* `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).\n\n* `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for an original source file.\n\n* `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.\n\n* `sourceContent` the content of the source file.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])\n\nApplies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.\nEach mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the\nsupplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings\nis the minimium of this map and the supplied map.\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.\n\n* `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.\n  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.\n  Otherwise an error will be thrown.\n\n* `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap\n  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same\n  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source\n  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten\n  relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,\n  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()\n\nRenders the source map being generated to a string.\n\n### SourceNode\n\nSourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating\nsnippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and\ncolumn information associated between those snippets and the original source\ncode. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might\nuse before outputting the generated JS and source map.\n\n#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])\n\n* `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if\n  it isn't associated with an original line.\n\n* `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null\n  if it isn't associated with an original column.\n\n* `source`: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.\n\n* `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see\n  below.\n\n* `name`: Optional. The original identifier.\n\n#### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])\n\nCreates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.\n\n* `code`: The generated code\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code\n\n* `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`\n  should be relative to.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)\n\nAdd a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)\n\nPrepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for a source file. This will be added to the\n`SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.\n\n* `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file\n\n* `sourceContent`: The content of the source file\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking\nfunction is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and\nthe its original associated source's line/column location.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each\nsource file content and is passed the filename and source content.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)\n\nLike `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator\nbetween each of this source node's children.\n\n* `sep`: The separator.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)\n\nCall `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful\nfor trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.\n\n* `pattern`: The pattern to replace.\n\n* `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toString()\n\nReturn the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and\nconcatenates all the various snippets together to one string.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])\n\nReturns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a\nSourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and\noriginal sources.\n\nThe arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.\n\n## Tests\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)\n\nInstall NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.\n\nTo add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-<your new test name>.js`\nand export your test functions with names that start with \"test\", for example\n\n```js\nexports[\"test doing the foo bar\"] = function (assert, util) {\n  ...\n};\n```\n\nThe new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.\n\nThe `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.\n\nThe `assert` argument is a cut down version of node's assert module. You have\naccess to the following assertion functions:\n\n* `doesNotThrow`\n\n* `equal`\n\n* `ok`\n\n* `strictEqual`\n\n* `throws`\n\n(The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the\ntests to run inside Firefox's test suite as well and so the assert module is\nshimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)\n\n[format]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n[feature]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Features/SourceMap\n[Dryice]: https://github.com/mozilla/dryice",

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

    "licenseText": "## Stable\n\nA stable array sort, because `Array#sort()` is not guaranteed stable.\n\nMIT licensed.\n\n[![Node.js CI](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable)\n\n[![Browser CI](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable)\n\n#### From npm\n\nInstall with:\n\n```sh\nnpm install stable\n```\n\nThen use it in Node.js or some other CommonJS environment as:\n\n```js\nconst stable = require('stable')\n```\n\n#### From the browser\n\nInclude [`stable.js`] or the minified version [`stable.min.js`]\nin your page, then call `stable()`.\n\n [`stable.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.js\n [`stable.min.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.min.js\n\n#### Usage\n\nThe default sort is, as with `Array#sort`, lexicographical:\n\n```js\nstable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']\nstable([10, 1, 5])             // => [1, 10, 5]\n```\n\nUnlike `Array#sort`, the default sort is **NOT** in-place. To do an in-place\nsort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:\n\n```js\nconst arr = [10, 1, 5]\nstable(arr) === arr          // => false\nstable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true\n```\n\nA comparator function can be specified:\n\n```js\n// Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number.\n// This demonstrates the default behavior.\nconst lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b)\nstable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']\n\n// Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true.\n// This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically.\nconst greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b\nstable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10]\n```\n\n#### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "licenseText": "# unicode-trie\nA data structure for fast Unicode character metadata lookup, ported from ICU\n\n## Background\n\nWhen implementing many Unicode algorithms such as text segmentation,\nnormalization, bidi processing, etc., fast access to character metadata\nis crucial to good performance.  There over a million code points in the\nUnicode standard, many of which produce the same result when looked up,\nso an array or hash table is not appropriate - those data structures are\nfast but would require a lot of memory.  The data is generally\ngrouped in ranges, so you could do a binary search, but that is not\nfast enough for some applications.\n\nThe [International Components for Unicode](http://site.icu-project.org) (ICU) project\ncame up with a data structure based on a [Trie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) that provides fast access\nto Unicode metadata.  The range data is precompiled to a serialized\nand flattened trie, which is then used at runtime to lookup the necessary\ndata.  According to my own tests, this is generally at least 50% faster\nthan binary search, with not too much additional memory required.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install unicode-trie\n\n## Building a Trie\n\nUnicode Tries are generally precompiled from data in the Unicode database\nfor faster runtime performance.  To build a Unicode Trie, use the\n`UnicodeTrieBuilder` class.\n\n```coffeescript\nUnicodeTrieBuilder = require 'unicode-trie/builder'\n\n# create a trie\nt = new UnicodeTrieBuilder\n\n# optional parameters for default value, and error value\n# if not provided, both are set to 0\nt = new UnicodeTrieBuilder 10, 999\n\n# set individual values and ranges\nt.set 0x4567, 99\nt.setRange 0x40, 0xe7, 0x1234\n\n# you can lookup a value if you like\nt.get 0x4567 # => 99\n\n# get a compiled trie (returns a UnicodeTrie object)\ntrie = t.freeze()\n\n# write compressed trie to a binary file\nfs.writeFile 'data.trie', t.toBuffer()\n```\n\n## Using a precompiled Trie\n\nOnce you've built a precompiled trie, you can load it into the\n`UnicodeTrie` class, which is a readonly representation of the\ntrie.  From there, you can lookup values.\n\n```coffeescript\nUnicodeTrie = require 'unicode-trie'\nfs = require 'fs'\n\n# load serialized trie from binary file\ndata = fs.readFileSync 'data.trie'\ntrie = new UnicodeTrie data\n\n# lookup a value\ntrie.get 0x4567 # => 99\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

    "licenseText": "# URI.js\n\nURI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc).\nIt is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.\n\nURI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).\n\n## API\n\n### Parsing\n\n\tURI.parse(\"uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//  scheme : \"uri\",\n\t//  userinfo : \"user:pass\",\n\t//  host : \"example.com\",\n\t//  port : 123,\n\t//  path : \"/one/two.three\",\n\t//  query : \"q1=a1&q2=a2\",\n\t//  fragment : \"body\"\n\t//}\n\n### Serializing\n\n\tURI.serialize({scheme : \"http\", host : \"example.com\", fragment : \"footer\"}) === \"http://example.com/#footer\"\n\n### Resolving\n\n\tURI.resolve(\"uri://a/b/c/d?q\", \"../../g\") === \"uri://a/g\"\n\n### Normalizing\n\n\tURI.normalize(\"HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html\") === \"http://abc.com/~smith/home.html\"\n\n### Comparison\n\n\tURI.equal(\"example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D\", \"eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d\") === true\n\n### IP Support\n\n\t//IPv4 normalization\n\tURI.normalize(\"//192.068.001.000\") === \"//192.68.1.0\"\n\n\t//IPv6 normalization\n\tURI.normalize(\"//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]\") === \"//[2001:0:db8::1]\"\n\n\t//IPv6 zone identifier support\n\tURI.parse(\"//[2001:db8::7%25en1]\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//  host : \"2001:db8::7%en1\"\n\t//}\n\n### IRI Support\n\n\t//convert IRI to URI\n\tURI.serialize(URI.parse(\"http://examplé.org/rosé\")) === \"http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9\"\n\t//convert URI to IRI\n\tURI.serialize(URI.parse(\"http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9\"), {iri:true}) === \"http://examplé.org/rosé\"\n\n### Options\n\nAll of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:\n\n*\t`scheme` (string)\n\n\tIndicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.\n\n*\t`reference` (string)\n\n\tIf set to `\"suffix\"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.\n\n*\t`tolerant` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.\n\n*\t`absolutePath` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.\n\n*\t`iri` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).\n\n*\t`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).\n\n*\t`domainHost` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).\n\n## Scheme Extendable\n\nURI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:\n\n*\thttp \\[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\\]\n*\thttps \\[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\\]\n*\tmailto \\[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\\]\n*\turn \\[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\\]\n*\turn:uuid \\[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\\]\n\n### HTTP Support\n\n\tURI.equal(\"HTTP://ABC.COM:80\", \"http://abc.com/\") === true\n\n### Mailto Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"mailto\",\n\t//\tto : [\"alpha@example.com\", \"bravo@example.com\"],\n\t//\tsubject : \"SUBSCRIBE\",\n\t//\tbody : \"Sign me up!\"\n\t//}\n\n\tURI.serialize({\n\t\tscheme : \"mailto\",\n\t\tto : [\"alpha@example.com\"],\n\t\tsubject : \"REMOVE\",\n\t\tbody : \"Please remove me\",\n\t\theaders : {\n\t\t\tcc : \"charlie@example.com\"\n\t\t}\n\t}) === \"mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me\"\n\n### URN Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"urn:example:foo\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"urn\",\n\t//\tnid : \"example\",\n\t//\tnss : \"foo\",\n\t//}\n\n#### URN UUID Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"urn\",\n\t//\tnid : \"example\",\n\t//\tuuid : \"f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\",\n\t//}\n\n## Usage\n\nTo load in a browser, use the following tag:\n\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js\"></script>\n\nTo load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:\n\n\tnpm install uri-js\n\nThen, in your code, load it using:\n\n\tconst URI = require(\"uri-js\");\n\nIf you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:\n\n\timport * as URI from \"uri-js\";\n\nOr you can load just what you need using named exports:\n\n\timport { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from \"uri-js\";\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n### Breaking changes from 3.x\n\nURN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.\n\nThe UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.\n\n### Breaking changes from 2.x\n\nURI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.\n\n### Breaking changes from 1.x\n\nThe `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.\n\n## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))\n\nCopyright 2011 Gary Court.

Time Zone Database\n\n      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone\n    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database\n    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone\n    Database section 7.\n\n     # 7.  Database Ownership\n     #\n     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\n     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\n     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\n     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\n     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\n     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\n     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\n     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\n     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\n     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made\n     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person\n     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\n     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\n  \"\"\"\n\n- libuv, located at deps/uv, is licensed as follows:\n  \"\"\"\n    libuv is part of the Node project: http://nodejs.org/\n    libuv may be distributed alone under Node's license:\n\n    ====\n\n    Copyright Joyent, Inc. and other Node contributors.

At\n    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\n    Compiled form of the Package.\n\n    (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\n    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\n    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\n    will be subject to the Original License.\n\n    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n\n    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\n    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\n    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\n    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\n    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\n    you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\n        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\n        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\n        Version.\n\n        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\n        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\n        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\n        from the name of the Standard Version.\n\n        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\n        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\n        under\n\n            (i)  the Original License or\n\n            (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\n            modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\n            licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\n            received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\n            Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n            available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\n            Fees are allowed.\n\n    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\n    or Modified Versions without the Source\n\n    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\n    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\n    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\n    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\n    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\n    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\n    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\n    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\n    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n\n    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\n    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\n    the Source of the Modified Version.\n\n    Aggregating or Linking the Package\n\n    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\n    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\n    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\n    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\n    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\n    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\n    as included in the aggregation.\n\n    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\n    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\n    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\n    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\n    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n\n    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n\n    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\n    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\n    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\n    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\n    terms of this license.\n\n    General Provisions\n\n    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\n    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\n    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\n    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\n    license.\n\n    (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\n    Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\n    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\n    this license.\n\n    (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\n    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n\n    (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\n    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\n    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\n    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\n    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\n    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\n    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\n    date that such litigation is filed.\n\n    (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\n    THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\n    IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED\n    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR\n    NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL\n    LAW.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

In most cases you should be using it with [`vue-loader`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader), you will only need it separately if you are writing build tools with very specific needs.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nnpm install vue-template-compiler\n```\n\n``` js\nconst compiler = require('vue-template-compiler')\n```\n\n## API\n\n### compiler.compile(template, [options])\n\nCompiles a template string and returns compiled JavaScript code. The returned result is an object of the following format:\n\n``` js\n{\n  ast: ?ASTElement, // parsed template elements to AST\n  render: string, // main render function code\n  staticRenderFns: Array<string>, // render code for static sub trees, if any\n  errors: Array<string> // template syntax errors, if any\n}\n```\n\nNote the returned function code uses `with` and thus cannot be used in strict mode code.\n\n#### Options\n\n- `outputSourceRange` *new in 2.6*\n  - Type: `boolean`\n  - Default: `false`\n\n  Set this to true will cause the `errors` returned in the compiled result become objects in the form of `{ msg, start, end }`. The `start` and `end` properties are numbers that mark the code range of the error source in the template. This can be passed on to the `compiler.generateCodeFrame` API to generate a code frame for the error.\n\n- `whitespace`\n  - Type: `string`\n  - Valid values: `'preserve' | 'condense'`\n  - Default: `'preserve'`\n\n  The default value `'preserve'` handles whitespaces as follows:\n\n  - A whitespace-only text node between element tags is condensed into a single space.\n  - All other whitespaces are preserved as-is.\n\n  If set to `'condense'`:\n\n  - A whitespace-only text node between element tags is removed if it contains new lines. Otherwise, it is condensed into a single space.\n  - Consecutive whitespaces inside a non-whitespace-only text node are condensed into a single space.\n\n  Using condense mode will result in smaller compiled code size and slightly improved performance. However, it will produce minor visual layout differences compared to plain HTML in certain cases.\n\n  **This option does not affect the `<pre>` tag.**\n\n  Example:\n\n  ``` html\n  <!-- source -->\n  <div>\n    <span>\n      foo\n    </span>   <span>bar</span>\n  </div>\n\n  <!-- whitespace: 'preserve' -->\n  <div> <span>\n    foo\n    </span> <span>bar</span> </div>\n\n  <!-- whitespace: 'condense' -->\n  <div><span> foo </span> <span>bar</span></div>\n  ```\n\n- `modules`\n\n  It's possible to hook into the compilation process to support custom template features. **However, beware that by injecting custom compile-time modules, your templates will not work with other build tools built on standard built-in modules, e.g `vue-loader` and `vueify`.**\n\n  An array of compiler modules. For details on compiler modules, refer to the `ModuleOptions` type in [flow declarations](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/flow/compiler.js#L47-L59) and the [built-in modules](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/compiler/modules).\n\n- `directives`\n\n  An object where the key is the directive name and the value is a function that transforms an template AST node. For example:\n\n  ``` js\n  compiler.compile('<div v-test></div>', {\n    directives: {\n      test (node, directiveMeta) {\n        // transform node based on directiveMeta\n      }\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n  By default, a compile-time directive will extract the directive and the directive will not be present at runtime. If you want the directive to also be handled by a runtime definition, return `true` in the transform function.\n\n  Refer to the implementation of some [built-in compile-time directives](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/compiler/directives).\n\n- `preserveWhitespace` **Deprecated since 2.6**\n  - Type: `boolean`\n  - Default: `true`\n\n  By default, the compiled render function preserves all whitespace characters between HTML tags. If set to `false`, whitespace between tags will be ignored. This can result in slightly better performance but may affect layout for inline elements.\n\n---\n\n### compiler.compileToFunctions(template)\n\nSimilar to `compiler.compile`, but directly returns instantiated functions:\n\n``` js\n{\n  render: Function,\n  staticRenderFns: Array<Function>\n}\n```\n\nThis is only useful at runtime with pre-configured builds, so it doesn't accept any compile-time options. In addition, this method uses `new Function()` so it is not CSP-compliant.\n\n---\n\n### compiler.ssrCompile(template, [options])\n\n> 2.4.0+\n\nSame as `compiler.compile` but generates SSR-specific render function code by optimizing parts of the template into string concatenation in order to improve SSR performance.\n\nThis is used by default in `vue-loader@>=12` and can be disabled using the [`optimizeSSR`](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/options.html#optimizessr) option.\n\n---\n\n### compiler.ssrCompileToFunctions(template)\n\n> 2.4.0+\n\nSame as `compiler.compileToFunction` but generates SSR-specific render function code by optimizing parts of the template into string concatenation in order to improve SSR performance.\n\n---\n\n### compiler.parseComponent(file, [options])\n\nParse a SFC (single-file component, or `*.vue` file) into a descriptor (refer to the `SFCDescriptor` type in [flow declarations](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/flow/compiler.js)). This is used in SFC build tools like `vue-loader` and `vueify`.\n\n---\n\n### compiler.generateCodeFrame(template, start, end)\n\nGenerate a code frame that highlights the part in `template` defined by `start` and `end`. Useful for error reporting in higher-level tooling.\n\n#### Options\n\n#### `pad`\n\n`pad` is useful when you are piping the extracted content into other pre-processors, as you will get correct line numbers or character indices if there are any syntax errors.\n\n- with `{ pad: \"line\" }`, the extracted content for each block will be prefixed with one newline for each line in the leading content from the original file to ensure that the line numbers align with the original file.\n- with `{ pad: \"space\" }`, the extracted content for each block will be prefixed with one space for each character in the leading content from the original file to ensure that the character count remains the same as the original file.",

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseFile": "node_modules/w3c-hr-time/README.md",
    "licenseText": "# w3c-hr-time\n\nThis module implements the W3C [High Resolution Time Level 2][HR-TIME] specification. It provides exactly three exports:\n\n- `Performance` class\n- `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS(): number`\n- `clockIsAccurate: boolean`\n\nIn all APIs, a \"high-resolution timestamp\" means a number in milliseconds that may have a fractional part, if the system clock is accurate enough (see \"Clock accuracy\" section below). It is identical to the [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`][] type in the High Resolution Time spec.\n\nPortability is paramount to this module. It uses only APIs exposed from Node.js core like `Date.now()` and `process.hrtime()` and does not use or require any native modules. It also employs the [browser-process-hrtime][] module for graceful degrades for platforms that do not have `process.hrtime()` (such as browsers).\n\n## `Performance` class\n\n```js\nconst { Performance } = require(\"w3c-hr-time\");\nconst performance = new Performance();\n\nconsole.log(performance.timeOrigin);\n// Prints a number close to Date.now() but that may have fractional parts, like\n// 1514888563819.351.\n\nconsole.log(new Date(performance.timeOrigin));\n// Prints a date close to new Date(), like 2018-01-02T10:22:43.819Z.\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  console.log(performance.now());\n  // Prints a number close to 5000, like 5008.023059.\n}, 5000);\n```\n\nPerhaps the most interesting export is the [`Performance`][] class. By constructing the class, you can get an instance quite similar to the `window.performance` object in browsers. Specifically, the following APIs are implemented:\n\n* [`performance.now(): number`][`Performance#now()`] returns the high-resolution duration since the construction of the `Performance` object.\n* [`performance.timeOrigin: number`][`Performance#timeOrigin`] is a high-resolution timestamp of the `Performance` object's construction, expressed in [Unix time][].\n* [`performance.toJSON(): object`][`Performance#toJSON()`] returns an object with `timeOrigin` property set to the corresponding value of this object. This allows serializing the `Performance` object with `JSON.stringify()`. In browsers, the returned object may contain additional properties such as `navigation` and `timing`. However, those properties are specific to browser navigation and are unsuitable for a Node.js implementation. Furthermore, they are specified not in the High Resolution Time spec but in [Navigation Timing][NAVIGATION-TIMING], and are thereby outside the scope of this module.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThis module does not aim for full [Web IDL][WEBIDL] conformance, so things like `performance.toJSON.call({})` will not throw `TypeError`s like it does in browsers. If you need full Web IDL conformance, you may be interested in the [webidl2js][] module.\n\nThe `Performance` class provided also does not have `mark()`, `measure()`, `getEntries()`, and such functions. They are specified in other specs than High Resolution Timing, such as [User Timing][USER-TIMING] (marks and measures) and [Performance Timeline][PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE] (entries management). Those specs extend the definition of the `Performance` class defined in High Resolution Timing, and to implement those specs you can extend the `Performance` class exported by this module.\n\nDue to the limitations of the APIs exposed through Node.js, the construction of a `Performance` object may take up to 1 millisecond to gather information for high-resolution `timeOrigin`.\n\n## Global monotonic clock\n\nThe High Resolution Time spec defines a [global monotonic clock][] that is \"shared by time origin's *[sic]*, is monotonically increasing and not subject to system clock adjustments or system clock skew, and whose reference point is the Unix time.\"\n\nThis module exports a function `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS()` that is the basis of all timing functions used my this module when a monotonic time is required. It returns a high-resolution timestamp whose zero value is at some arbitrary point in the past. (For the current high-resolution timestamp based on the Unix epoch, use `new Performance().timeOrigin` instead.)\n\n```js\nconst { getGlobalMonotonicClockMS } = require(\"w3c-hr-time\");\n\nconst start = getGlobalMonotonicClockMS();\nconsole.log(start);\n// Prints a millisecond timestamp based on an arbitrary point in the past, like\n// 280249733.012151.\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  console.log(getGlobalMonotonicClockMS() - a);\n  // Prints a number close to 5000, like 5006.156536.\n}, 5000);\n```\n\nUnlike other functions that return only integer timestamps if the system clock does not provide enough resolution, this function may still return timestamps with fractional parts on those systems with less accurate clocks. See \"Clock accuracy\" section below for more information.\n\n## Clock accuracy\n\nThe High Resolution Time spec [states][HR-TIME §4] that\n\n> A [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`][] *SHOULD* represent a time in milliseconds accurate to 5 microseconds - see [8. Privacy and Security][HR-TIME §8].\n>\n> If the User Agent is unable to provide a time value accurate to 5 microseconds due to hardware or software constraints, the User Agent can represent a [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`][] as a time in milliseconds accurate to a millisecond.\n\nThis module implements this suggestion faithfully. It executes a test at `require()`-time to determine if the system clock (both `Date.now()` and `process.hrtime()`) is accurate enough to 5 microseconds. The result of this test can be accessed through the exported `clockIsAccurate` boolean value.\n\n```js\nconst { Performance, clockIsAccurate } = require(\"w3c-hr-time\");\n\nconst performance = new Performance();\n\nif (!clockIsAccurate) {\n  console.assert(Number.isInteger(performance.timeOrigin));\n  console.assert(Number.isInteger(performance.now()));\n}\n```\n\nIf `clockIsAccurate` is false, `performance.timeOrigin` and `performance.now()` are always rounded to millisecond accuracy. `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS()` however is exempt from this requirement due to its best-effort nature, and the fact that it is not an API exposed by the High Resolution Time spec.\n\n## Clock drift\n\n[Clock drift][clock drift] can be observed through system or user clock adjustments -- that is, the speed at which `Date.now()` changes may be faster or slower than real time if there is a pending adjustment to the system clock, for example through NTP synchronizing.\n\nIn the spec, the [global monotonic clock][] is defined to be immune to such drifts. Correspondingly, the APIs exposed through this module that are defined using the global monotonic clock such as `performance.now()` and `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS()` are also guaranteed to reflect real time.\n\nFor example, if `performance.now()` returns 1000, it is guaranteed that the time of this call is exactly one second since the construction of the `Performance` object. But the difference in `Date.now()`'s value from the construction of the `Performance` object to when `performance.now()` returns 1000 may not be exactly 1000. You may also see `performance.now() - Date.now()` diverge over time as a result of clock drifts.\n\nOn the other hand, `performance.timeOrigin` returns the *[Unix time][]* at which the `Performance` object is constructed and relies on the current time exposed through `Date.now()`. That means that it is susceptible to clock drifts that has occurred before the `Performance` object was constructed.\n\n[HR-TIME]: https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/\n[NAVIGATION-TIMING]: https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/\n[PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE]: https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/\n[USER-TIMING]: https://w3c.github.io/user-timing/\n[WEBIDL]: https://heycam.github.io/webidl/\n\n[HR-TIME §4]: https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/#dom-domhighrestimestamp\n[HR-TIME §8]: https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/#privacy-security\n\n[`DOMHighResTimeStamp`]: https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/#dom-domhighrestimestamp\n[`Performance`]: https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/#dfn-performance\n[`Performance#now()`]: https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/#dom-performance-now\n[`Performance#timeOrigin`]: https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/#dom-performance-timeorigin\n[`Performance#toJSON()`]: https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/#dom-performance-tojson\n[browser-process-hrtime]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-process-hrtime\n[clock drift]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_drift\n[global monotonic clock]: https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/#dfn-global-monotonic-clock\n[Unix time]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time\n[webidl2js]: https://github.com/jsdom/webidl2js",

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",
